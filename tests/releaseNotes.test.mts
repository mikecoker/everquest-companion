// What's new (src/shared/releaseNotes.ts) — JOS-73.
//
// TWO CLAIMS ARE UNDER TEST AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF CLAIM.
//
//   THE DATA. `RELEASE_NOTES` is hand-written and grows by one entry per release forever, which
//   makes it exactly the sort of file that acquires a duplicate version, a date typed in the
//   wrong order, or a row inserted in the wrong place — none of which would throw, and all of
//   which would quietly break the ordering every derivation below assumes. `releaseNotesProblems`
//   is the shape check, and it is the SAME function the release job runs
//   (scripts/check-release-notes.mjs), so a tag that ships is a tag whose notes passed this.
//
//   THE DERIVATION. "Which releases are new to this install" is a pure function of one stored
//   string, and every state it can be in is reachable here in a line: the fresh install that must
//   see nothing, the one-release upgrade, and the A→D case — 0.6.3 landing on 0.8.0 marks BOTH
//   0.7.0 and 0.8.0, which is the whole reason the key stores a version instead of a boolean.
//
// No Electron, no store file, no renderer: shared/releaseNotes.ts is a zero-import pure module,
// so this suite is as cheap and as unskippable as graphicsPrefs/overlayLayout.

// Logs folder, or a log file" — one setting, three inputs. A comma is not evidence of a packed
// list, and a test that says it is teaches the next author to write worse sentences to satisfy it.
//
// What IS decidable is the COUNT: the defect this ticket fixed was a release with four changes in
// its tag range shipping as one bullet, and a release's bullet count is a fact. That is what the
// test below pins, and the prose stays a review question.
