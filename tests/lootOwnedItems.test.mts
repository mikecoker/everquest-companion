// ============================================================================
// JOS-160 — the Loot page can find what you OWN, not only what you looted.
// ============================================================================
//
// THE REPORT (v0.15.0): the Loot page cannot see `Ivory Sky Diamond` at all — search returns
// nothing, and the item page says it has never been looted — while the Plane of Sky tab shows the
// item held and the Paladin Test of Spirit ready to hand in, with `/finditem` and `/outputfile
// inventory` both saying three copies.
//
// THE MECHANISM, and it is none of the three things the report looks like:
//
//   * NOT a name. There is exactly one spelling of the item anywhere in the tree — items.json,
//     posky.json, quests.json, mobs.json all say `Ivory Sky Diamond` — with no alias and no `+N`
//     variant. `itemCountKey` is a no-op on it. (Pinned below, the way JOS-66 pinned the same
//     question for the Woolen items.)
//   * NOT a parser gap. Nothing else could be: the loot module folds `kind === 'loot'` and nothing
//     else by design, and these copies were acquired before this log exists, so no loot line for
//     them will ever appear.
//   * NOT the keyring. JOS-66's rule already counts `Equipment` keyring rows, which is precisely
//     WHY the Sky tab reads three and is right to.
//
// The Loot page's corpus is the LOOT LEDGER; the Sky tab's is what you HOLD. Both come out of the
// same `reconcile` call, and the divergence is one expression in it: `buildRows` used to skip a row
// whose ACTIVE-source base was 0, which under the default count source `log` deleted every item
// known only to the dump. `net` — the map the quest counting reads — is written BEFORE that skip,
// so the Sky tab kept its answer while the Loot page went blind. That asymmetry is the first thing
// this file pins, because it is both the bug and the regression gate for the fix.
//
// THE FIXTURE IS THE OWNER'S REAL DUMP, and the reporter's three copies are INJECTED as parsed
// counts rather than fabricated into a file (the reporter-slice rule, AGENTS.md). His bytes are
// not in this repo and inventing a dump shape to stand in for them would be inventing evidence;
// `heldCountsFromDump` is already pinned against real files by tests/outputsInventory.test.mts and
// tests/skyKeyringHeld.test.mts, so the parse is not what needs proving here — the reconciliation
// downstream of it is.
//
// Run: `npm test`.
