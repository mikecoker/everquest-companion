// JOS-176 — A CC HOLD SPEAKS FOR AN ENGAGED HOSTILE, AND ONLY WHILE IT IS ONE.
//
// THE REPORT (owner, Sun Aug 09, Fused Hate run): the Grandmaster R`tal encounter opened at
// 20:10:02, SEVENTY-EIGHT SECONDS before the pull, so the boss fight's meter carried the whole
// preceding twin skirmish and its start clock was nonsense.
//
// WHAT THE REAL BYTES SAY (measured with a throwaway replay of the owner's log, and the reason
// the brief's diagnosis is only half the story). `Encounter.ccActiveUntil` is a per-instance
// claim that a mez'd mob is alive and still in this fight; it vetoes the DEATH-CLOSE. Two kinds
// of entity can carry that stamp and can never be an answer to the question it asks:
//
//   1. A RETIRED INSTANCE. Retirement is final — any later action by that name mints a fresh
//      `nameKey#gen` — so the hold is unredeemable the instant the world model retires the slot.
//      Only `ingestDeath` used to clear it, so a mob aged out by STALENESS kept vetoing for the
//      rest of its 120 seconds. Whole-log measurement: 1,311 retirements carried an unexpired
//      hold via the death path (cleaned up) and 614 via the staleness path (not).
//   2. A LIVE PET OF YOURS. `hostilePresence()` has always excluded live pets from "is anything
//      still alive here" — a pet never dies, so counting it would pin every charm-grind fight
//      open forever — but the hold loop beside it did not. This is the case the owner actually
//      hit, and it exists because in the Plane of Hate his charmed pet and the mobs he is killing
//      SHARE ONE NAME (`Innoruuk`s Chosen`): when the last hostile twin died, the caster-only
//      `Your Dazzle spell has worn off of <name>` line (a CC refresh, JOS-161) resolved to the
//      only instance of that name still live — the pet — and stamped 120 seconds on it. 507 CC
//      events in the owner's log land their hold on a live pet this way.
//
// The mez-and-wait veto for a LIVE MEZZED HOSTILE is untouched and is pinned here and in
// tests/combatClosureDiscipline.test.mts (CC1–CC3).
