// PLANNER FARM-ROLLUP TESTS — which zone a donor is filed under, and why (JOS-42, refinement 4).
//
// THE TRUST BUG THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. A farm plan filed Batfang Headband under DRAGON NECROPOLIS
// — a Velious zone this server has not opened — while Western Plains of Karana, where five
// classic-era ogres drop the same headband, sat in the row's muted "also:" tail. The rollup was
// not wrong about the facts; it was wrong about which of them to lead with. Its tiebreak was
// alphabetical (header: "a stable, statable rule beats whichever the scrape listed first"), and
// `Dragon Necropolis` < `Timorous Deep` < `Western Plains of Karana`. So the one heading the whole
// feature exists to produce — "go here next" — named a place the player cannot go.
//
// SO THE ANCHOR IS THE REAL CATALOG, not a hand-built fixture. `src/renderer/src/data/eqlegends/
// mobs.json` is committed data, and every zone below was read out of it: a carrion bat and a
// Chetari guard in Dragon Necropolis (velious), four ogres in Western Plains of Karana (classic),
// The Great Oowomp in Timorous Deep (kunark). If a rescrape ever moves those, this test is
// supposed to notice — that is what makes it an anchor rather than a mock.
//
// The rest is the arithmetic the header states, pinned as identities: every need appears exactly
// once, the weights still choose the zone that feeds the most of the list, and the alphabetical
// tiebreak survives inside whichever candidate set the era rule leaves standing.
//
// WHAT JOS-326 CHANGED HERE, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DID NOT. The rollup used to be fed by
// `collectNeeds(plan, …)`, which walked an exaltation set's cells; the plan board is gone and the
// wish list feeds it now (`features/wishlist/wishFarm.ts`, pinned by tests/wishFarm.test.mts). So
// this file builds its needs DIRECTLY — which is what it should always have done, because the
// thing under test is the GROUPING and a collector standing between it and the assertion was only
// ever a way for a change in one to look like a failure in the other. Not one zone claim, weight
// or tiebreak below moved.
