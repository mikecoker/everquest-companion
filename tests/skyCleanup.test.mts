// ============================================================================
// skyCleanup.test.mts — THE CLEANUP TAB'S WHOLE RULE, without a browser (JOS-389).
// ============================================================================
//
// The tab is a list of rows and a warning; the DECISION is `features/posky/cleanup.ts`, and it is
// the part that can be wrong in a way that costs a player an item. So every case the ticket named
// is driven here against the real module, and the SENTENCES are asserted too — the row's copy is
// produced by the model precisely so it can be pinned without a DOM.
//
// The five cases the brief asked for, in order below:
//   1. a shared item held while ANOTHER quest that needs it is un-turned-in — excluded
//   2. an item whose only quest was turned in twice, with enough in hand for one more set — K = 1
//   3. an item at have 3 / need 4 — the "X of Y" line rather than a "keep them"
//   4. a Dragon-Hoard-shaped extra dump lane — the place reads whatever the client called it
//   5. an override zeroing the count — the row leaves the list
//
// The dump case is SYNTHETIC and its test name says so, following `tests/carryAll.test.mts`: no
// dump anywhere carries hoard rows, so the subject is this module's classification of a shape and
// never a claim about what EverQuest prints.
