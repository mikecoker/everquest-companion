// GOLDEN WINDOW: the SELF rune-absorb miss (`YOUR magical skin absorbs the blow!`).
//
// THE BUG (user-reported, integrator-verified against the real log). MISS_RE's absorb
// alternative was written as
//
//     |.+?'s magical skin (absorbs) the blow)
//
// which requires a POSSESSIVE `<name>'s magical skin`. That matches the third-person twin — a
// MOB's own rune eating OUR swing (`You try to slash Kahaptra Z`Taj, but Kahaptra Z`Taj's magical
// skin absorbs the blow!`) — but it can never match the SELF form, where the game writes no name
// at all:
//
//     A deadly black widow tries to bite YOU, but YOUR magical skin absorbs the blow!
//
// So no self-form line ever produced a MISS event. (Originally they fell through the whole
// classify() battery to the 'unknown' kind; Task #59's heal meter then added a downstream
// SKIN_ABSORB_BLOW_RE branch that claimed them as `mitigation`/'absorbSwing' — which fixed the
// absorption COUNT but left the defensive miss aggregate just as blind, because a mitigation event
// never reaches routeMiss.) Full-log sweep (2026-08-02, eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt):
//
//     385  bare `YOUR magical skin absorbs the blow!`     — silently DROPPED
//   1,428  possessive `<name>'s magical skin absorbs …`   — parsed fine
//     235  `YOUR magical skin absorbs the damage of <X>'s thorns.` — a different family
//                                                            (mitigation/absorbDamageShield),
//                                                            already parsed, not affected here
//
// Nothing else in the log says "absorb": the only other hits are two player chat lines, which the
// fixture scrub drops anyway. There is no Riposte-variant or alternative absorb phrasing to find.
//
// THE BLAST RADIUS is exactly one aggregate. Every self-form line is an INCOMING avoided swing, so
// the loss was an undercount in `addIncMiss` — the per-mob incoming miss counts and therefore the
// DEFENSIVE hit% / avoidance breakdown. No damage total could move: a miss carries no amount
// (AGENTS.md law 8), and the self-form lines never carried one in either lane.
//
// BEFORE/AFTER on this exact fixture (both replays run, pre-fix parser vs post-fix):
//                                    pre-fix                        post-fix
//   incoming "a Teir`Dal priest"     3 misses, absorb 0, hit 50%    5 misses, absorb 2, hit 37.5%
//   incoming "Kahaptra Z`Taj"        1 miss,   absorb 0             identical
//   outgoing "You"                   31 misses, absorb 3            identical
//   damage totals (2247 / 74 / 87)   —                              byte-identical
//   mitigation.absorbedSwings        2                              2  ← the no-double-count gate
// One row moved, and it is the row the bug report named.
//
// THE FIX (src/main/log/parser.ts): a second absorb alternative, `(YOUR) magical skin absorbs the
// blow`, as group 9. The two shapes are DISJOINT — `.+?'s ` needs a literal apostrophe-s the
// `YOUR` form does not have — so the possessive path is provably untouched. DEFENDER RESOLUTION
// differs between them and is the subtle part: the possessive branch takes the defender from the
// swing's OBJECT capture (group 2), because the object IS the named mob whose rune fired. The self
// branch has no name to capture, so it supplies the defender itself: `YOUR magical skin` can only
// ever describe the player, so the defender is You. (Group 2 does read "YOU" on all 385 real
// lines, but the branch — not the object text — is the authority.)
//
// KNOCK-ON, verified rather than assumed:
//   - defenderLabel() gating (Task #58) is untouched. The self form resolves to target 'You',
//     which defenderLabel short-circuits to 'You' before any world lookup, so a whiff still
//     spawns no instance and drifts no gen counter (law 8).
//   - the absorbed-swing COUNT in the healing meter is unchanged. The engine counts absorbed
//     swings off BOTH lanes — routeMitigation('absorbSwing') and routeMiss(mtype 'absorb',
//     incoming) — and a line yields EXACTLY ONE event, so moving the self form from the first
//     lane to the second can neither double-count nor drop it. Both lanes also use the SAME
//     encounter gate (`ts - current.lastTs <= FALLBACK_IDLE_MS`), so the per-fight count is
//     unchanged too, not just the zone one. Measured: 2 before, 2 after. W27 in
//     healingWindows.test.mts pins its single absorbed swing at 1 across the same change.
//
// THE WINDOW — tests/fixtures/w29-absorb-both-shapes.log, raw log lines 990649..990795
// (Sun Aug 02 15:25:34 → 15:26:04), extracted verbatim by tests/extract-combat-fixtures.mjs (one
// player chat line dropped by the shared scrub). It is the tightest real span carrying BOTH absorb
// shapes, so one replay proves the fix and the no-regression at once. HAND-READ, every avoided
// swing in the file:
//
//   OUTGOING (You → mob), 31 total:
//     Kahaptra Z`Taj  12 = 9 plain misses + 3 POSSESSIVE absorbs (his rune ate our slashes at
//                          15:25:34, :36, :36) — these must stay OUTGOING and must never be
//                          credited to our mitigation.
//     a Teir`Dal priest 19 = 18 plain misses + 1 parry (15:25:55)
//     ⇒ breakdown miss 27 · parry 1 · absorb 3
//
//   INCOMING (mob → You), 6 total:
//     Kahaptra Z`Taj     1 = 1 plain miss (15:25:40 crush)
//     a Teir`Dal priest  5 = 3 plain misses (15:25:49 crush, 15:25:49 bash, 15:25:55 crush)
//                          + 2 SELF absorbs (15:25:57 bash, 15:26:01 crush)  ← THE BUG.
//                          Before the fix this row read 3 and its absorb bucket read 0.
//
//   ABSORPTION ledger: 9 rune grants (13+25+9+26+1+19+16+9+11 = 129, max 26, min 1),
//                      4 absorbed thorns ticks, 2 absorbed swings — all count-only families
//                      unchanged in shape by this fix.
//
// The two pulls are ONE encounter (the priest lands damage 4s after Kahaptra dies, inside the
// death-linger), which is why the fight-scoped and zone-scoped incoming rows agree below. The one
// outgoing miss that is NOT in the encounter is the very first line of the window: it precedes the
// first landed damage, and law 8 says a miss never OPENS an encounter, so it reaches the zone
// aggregate only (31 zone vs 30 fight).
