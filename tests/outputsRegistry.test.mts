// ============================================================================
// THE `/outputfile` REGISTRY — the facts half (JOS-44).
// ============================================================================
//
// `shared/outputs/kinds.ts` is the ONE place that knows, per export command: what the player
// types, one clause of why, what the file is called, and whether we may parse it. Both the main
// process (find + watch + parse) and the renderer (the freshness line) read it, which is the
// whole point — before this the command string was hand-typed per surface.
//
// So what is pinned here is the CONTRACT the two sides rely on:
//   * every kind carries a command, a why-clause and a distinct filename suffix, and the command
//     is spelled the way the game's own kind id is (a typo'd command is a user typing a typo);
//   * the filename PREFERENCE rule — which of several dumps belongs to this character — is a
//     pure function over names, so it is proved here without a filesystem;
//   * the no-guessing law's flags stay coherent: only a `supported` kind may claim a verified
//     filename suffix.
//
// The disk half (`src/main/outputs/registry.ts`: does it exist, its mtime, the watcher) needs
// `effectiveEqRoot()` and therefore electron-store, so it is exercised by the app itself and by
// `tests/e2e/planner.e2e.mts`, not from here. What that half CAN be held to without a disk is
// that it never invents facts of its own — every field of `OutputFileStatus` below either comes
// from a def or from a stat.
//
// Run: `npm test`.
