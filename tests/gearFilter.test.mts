// GEAR TAB — the filter, the sort, the columns and the plus-state wiring (JOS-284, phase 3). Pure
// model only: `src/renderer/src/features/gear/gearFilter.ts` and `gearColumns.ts` touch no React,
// no storage and no IPC, so they run under the node runner like `plannerGroups` and
// `plannerClasses` before them.
//
// THE FIXTURES ARE THE TWO ITEMS PHASE 0 IS PINNED ON, with their base vectors copied from
// `tests/gearIndex.test.mts` (which asserts them against the REAL corpus). That is the point of
// spelling them out here rather than building the index: if the corpus ever states different
// numbers for Thelvorn, gearIndex.test.mts goes red FIRST and names the corpus, instead of this
// file going red and blaming the filter.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR, in one sentence: the gear table's answers must be the SCALED ones. The
// sort and every number the table draws read the vector AFTER `scaleAll`, so ranking by ratio under
// a `+5` slider ranks the weapons AS THEY WOULD BE at +5.
//
// THAT SENTENCE USED TO SAY "a threshold, a ratio floor and a sort", and JOS-302's fourth owner ask
// deleted the first two outright. The consequence is stated as its own test below — the plus-state
// can now move WHAT A ROW READS and never WHICH ROWS ARE SHOWN, because nothing that filters reads
// a number any more. That is a smaller claim than the one this file used to make, and writing the
// smaller one down is the point: the parser tests, the `meetsThresholds` tests and the ratio-floor
// test are GONE rather than weakened, because the code they described is gone.
//
// AND SINCE JOS-302 IT CARRIES THE THREE NARROWINGS THE OWNER ASKED FOR, each with its own claim:
//   * THE CLASS PICKS REMOVE ROWS. They used to chip them and enforce nothing; the owner overruled
//     that for this surface. The test below is the OLD test rewritten rather than deleted, and it
//     still pins the half that did NOT change — a page stating no class list survives, because
//     silence is not a refusal.
//   * SEVERAL SLOTS ARE A UNION, and the union ANDs with everything else.
//   * A WEAPON TYPE IS A FOLD OF THE CORPUS'S OWN `Skill:` SPELLINGS, and a category is nothing but
//     a union of types. The spelling census over the REAL corpus lives in tests/gearIndex.test.mts,
//     where the bytes are; what is pinned here is the vocabulary and the predicate.
