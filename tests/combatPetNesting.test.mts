// PET NESTING IS PRESENTATION, AND IT CONSERVES EVERY NUMBER.
//
// The default combat view drills into YOUR damage and shows the pet as ONE line item inside it
// (owner direction, 2026-08-03: the game is mostly played solo, so a two-row source meter is a
// lid on the only list worth reading). That regrouping happens entirely in the renderer, over the
// snapshot the engine sends — you and each pet as their own authoritative `SourceView`, which is
// now the ONLY thing the engine sends (its own pet fold is deleted; see the bottom of this file).
//
// These are pure derivations over already-aggregated data, so the window is synthetic (the same
// footing as tests/combatSlayGrouping.test.mts): there is no log line to hand-read, only the
// invariants that make the layout HONEST —
//
//   1. the pet is its OWN row, never added into a skill lane of yours (law 4: "pet" is not a
//      data-model class; the damage attribution is the engine's and must survive the layout);
//   2. the row is labelled with the pet's REAL display name off its source row (law 2: display
//      raw), never a coined "Pet";
//   3. the combined total is self + pets — which is `SegmentView.outTotal`, the number both the
//      Combat panel header and the Overview card headline, so the two can never disagree;
//   4. turning the preference off yields EXACTLY today's list (your skills, no pet row);
//   5. bar widths are re-based over the merged list, so the biggest row — usually the pet — is
//      the one that renders full width.
//
// THE PREFERENCE IS THE PET'S LAYOUT, AND ONLY THAT (owner ruling, 2026-08-05 — JOS-35). It used
// to double as the default ZOOM: with nesting on, every meter opened INSIDE your breakdown. That
// stopped being right the moment the meters grew group-mates, and it hid the pet double-count
// below — so every surface opens on LEVEL 1 now, and the preference decides only where the pet's
// damage lives. The last blocks walk the owner's whole navigation loop (in → out → in) in both
// preference states, and pin the fold. Verified against a real charmed-pet fight before it
// was written: Plane of Sky, Tue Aug 04 22:48–22:52, `a thunder spirit` charmed with Allure VI —
// the engine binds it, hands it over as a `kind: 'pet'` SourceView, and one segment of that
// session legitimately carries TWO pet sources (the first charm broke and a second was landed),
// which is the multi-line case pinned at the bottom of this file.

// does); everything else is this builder's job, because a token is only worth keeping if it can

// same-named pets are both in the segment — the two-pet case is pinned above), the name only as
// the rescue that keeps the drill from degrading.
