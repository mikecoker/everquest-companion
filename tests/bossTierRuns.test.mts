// PER-TIER KILL RUNS — the Lord of Ire misattribution (owner-verified, 2026-08-04).
//
// THE BUG, exactly. The kill record was five scalars {count, bestTier, firstTs, lastTs,
// display} and the fold took Math.max on BOTH the tier and the timestamp, so those two facts
// could describe DIFFERENT kills. The bosses roster then grouped each target by the class-combo
// interval covering its `lastTs` while painting its `bestTier`. The user killed Lord of Ire at
// d4 (Refined) on Sat Aug 01 16:09:29 running PAL/MNK/ENC, and again at d0 (base) on Mon Aug 03
// 23:02:44 running ROG/PAL/BER after a loadout swap on Sun Aug 02 01:57:42. The card rendered a
// d4 badge filed under ROG/PAL/BER — a loadout that never killed it at d4.
//
// WHAT THAT SECOND KILL IS CALLED NOW (JOS-166). The Mon Aug 03 kill was in `The Plane of Hate`
// with no `- Solo` suffix — the OPEN WORLD, which has no instance and therefore no lockout. It
// used to fold to tier 0 because a bare zone name and a base instance decoded identically; it
// now folds to TIER_OPEN_WORLD. The misattribution this file pins is unaffected either way: what
// it is about is that a run's tier and its timestamps describe the SAME kills, and the two runs
// here are still two runs. The assertions below name the key rather than assuming 0.
//
// The combo-interval layer was CORRECT and is untouched here (world-model law 10: intervals are
// revisable and join at READ; nothing stamps an interval id onto a kill). What was lossy was the
// KILL RECORD. It is now per instance tier (`KillInfo.tiers`, shared/kills.ts), the four scalars
// are DERIVED from that map, and the roster splits a multi-tier target into one card per tier —
// each joining the intervals at its OWN most recent kill and wearing its OWN badge.
//
// What is pinned below:
//   1. THE FOLD, against the real log window (tests/fixtures/bosstier-lord-of-ire.log, cut by
//      tests/extract-boss-tier-fixtures.mjs from raw lines 853620 / 865678.. / 1205559 /
//      1211528..): one entry, two tier runs, each keeping its own timestamps.
//   2. THE JOIN: d4 files under the Aug-01 interval, the open-world run under the Aug-03 one —
//      and the OLD rule (join at the target's overall lastTs) is shown to produce the wrong
//      answer on the same data, so a regression cannot pass quietly. The two intervals here state
//      DIFFERENT trios, which is why they are two sections: since JOS-236 the sectioning merges
//      intervals stating the SAME loadout, and that law has its own file
//      (tests/loadoutSections.test.mts). Both build their intervals with comboFixtures.mts.
//   3. NO VISUAL REGRESSION for the common case: a single-tier target yields exactly one card
//      whose status is deep-equal to the unprojected one.
//   4. THE DELTA CONTRACT: a changed mob REPLACES its entry wholesale, and a baseline written
//      under a different shape version is invalidated rather than merged into.
//   5. THE RECOMPUTE PATH: the KillMap is a pure function of the log, rebuilt from scratch every
//      load — which is why widening it ships NO store migration (ProgressState persists
//      inventory / completedQuests / combo corrections and no kill data whatsoever).
//
// Imported RELATIVELY: node tests run through tsx with no `@shared` / `@renderer` aliases.
