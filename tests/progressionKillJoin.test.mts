// GOLDEN-WINDOW TESTS FOR THE RECENT-KILLS RING AND ITS EXPERIENCE JOIN.
//
// A sibling of progressionWindows.test.mts (same fixtures, same replay methodology) rather than
// more of it: that file is at the measured 400-code-line factoring ceiling, and this is its own
// subject — WHAT you killed and what it paid, as opposed to the range statistics.
//
// THE DIRECTION OF THE JOIN WAS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED — and the feature brief had it BACKWARDS
// ("a credited kill takes the NEXT experience line"). FULL-LOG SWEEP (read-only, 1.11M lines):
// 4909 experience lines, 5988 slain lines; for 4887 of the 4909 the nearest slain line is the one
// AFTER it, with a timestamp gap of 0 s (4856×) or 1 s (25×). The experience line PRECEDES its
// kill line — always, and essentially always in the same second. Not one experience line in the
// whole log follows its kill inside 4 s.
//
// So the join looks BACK: a kill claims the most recent unclaimed experience line within
// KILL_EXP_JOIN_MS before it, and claiming CONSUMES the line so it can never be attributed twice.
// Every expectation below is read off the fixture in that order.
//
//   WL45  the join in eleven rows, including a kill that paid NOTHING and a bound-pet kill.
//   WL43  at the cap: the line joins and states no size — a different unknown from "no line".
//   WL44  party experience, joined and labeled.
// Plus synthesized edge cases for the rule itself, the drop-oldest ring, the renderer's delta
// merge, and a full-log tripwire built from IDENTITIES over the experience column (the live log
// grows, and its CONTENT changes character as the owner plays — see JOS-234 at the bottom).

// no corpse anywhere near them. The join was never the variable; the DENOMINATOR was.
//
// So the tripwire now states what the sentence always meant — WHEN EXPERIENCE IS PAID, THE JOIN
// FINDS IT — over the kills that could have been paid. The oracle is the experience COLUMN,
