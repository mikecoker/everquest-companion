// PROC ACCURACY — the owner's 2026-08-04 report, pinned in both directions.
//
// The report was two screenshots of the same fight disagreeing with each other:
//
//   DEFECT 1  Banishing / Clumsiness / Stunning / Weakening Strike and Divine Stun I read
//             `0 landed · N resisted` in the combat drill, while the header of the panel BESIDE
//             them counted "90 slow landings this segment". Cause: an effect proc's LANDING is
//             a per-spell emote that names no spell (`<mob>'s limbs move slower!`) while its
//             RESIST names the spell like any other (`A wanderer resisted your Weakening
//             Strike!`), so the drill's lane was built out of resists alone and its `hits` were
//             the only "landed" it knew about. Real-log counts, sweep 2026-08-04:
//               Weakening Strike   562 emote landings vs  34 resists
//               Stunning Strike    430                vs  29
//               Clumsiness Strike  189                vs  37
//               Banishing Strike    19                vs   3
//             Every one of those rows was reporting a 100% resist rate.
//
//   DEFECT 2  Spells the owner casts appearing as `proc`. Measured per spell (procDetect's
//             header carries the full table), it is TWO shapes and neither is a window-width
//             problem — one is a HoT whose ticks are cast-detached, the other is the Quick Buff
//             AA delivering memorized buffs with no cast line at all.
//
// AND THE OTHER DIRECTION, which is why half this file is about spells that KEEP their tag:
// three of the six spells named in the report are genuine procs, and the log proves it by
// never once printing a cast for them. `Earthquake` (0 casts / 87 firings, an illusion proc),
// `Condemnation of Nife` (0 / 1,569, the Instrument of Nife aura) and `Dismiss Undead`
// (10 casts on Jul 20, then 388 firings over the following two weeks — the Ghoulbane weapon
// proc) must all survive any fix to defect 2, and w43 is here so a future "just demote anything
// with a cast line" cannot quietly delete them.
//
// FIXTURES: w42-effect-proc-resist.log and w43-earthquake-proc.log (cut by
// tests/extract-proc-fixtures.mjs, headers there), plus the shipped w7-quick-buff.log,
// w40-nife-buff.log and w35+w41 poison pair.
