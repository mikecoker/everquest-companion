//
//   npx tsx tests/extract-session-fixtures.mjs "<path-to-eqlog>"
//
// (Run it under the tsx loader like its siblings: tests/fixture-scrub.mjs is now a shim over
// the TypeScript src/shared/logScrub.ts, so a bare `node` invocation depends on the runtime's
// type-stripping being enabled. Both were verified to produce byte-identical fixtures here.)
//
// SCRUB: routed through the SHARED scrub (tests/fixture-scrub.mjs), like every extractor.
// VERIFIED against the full log (2026-08-03): all 20 `Welcome to EverQuest Legends!`, all 20
// camp-initiation lines, both `You abandon your preparations to camp.` lines and all 78
// countdown ticks survive `scrubKeep` untouched — 0 dropped. No KEEP carve-out was needed and
// fixture-scrub.mjs is UNCHANGED. That is expected: these are system messages with no speaker,
// no quoted speech and no proper name, so none of the five DROP families can reach them.
// (Re-run `node tests/extract-session-fixtures.mjs <log>` if the scrub's DROP list ever grows —
// it asserts the survival counts and fails loudly rather than writing a hollowed-out fixture.)
//
// WHAT IS KEPT INSIDE A WINDOW: everything the scrub allows, verbatim and contiguous. That is
// load-bearing here in a way it is not for other families — the offline-gap rule anchors on
// THE TIMESTAMPS OF SURROUNDING EVENTS (see src/main/log/sessionDetector.ts), so filtering a
// window down to "just the session lines" would silently change the answer. The countdown
// ticks in particular are what keep `fromTs` at the end of the camp instead of at its start.
//
// Line numbers below were located in eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt on 2026-08-03. The log only
// ever APPENDS, so historical line numbers stay valid as it grows; re-locate if it is
// truncated or rotated.

// announced the logout, which is exactly the point: the absence is real and `camped` must read
// false.
//
// TWO SPANS SINCE JOS-262, and the reason is the anchor rule (sessionDetector.ts). The player
// went A.F.K. at 20:50 and stood in somebody else's raid: the last line the log prints ABOUT
// HIM is `Your power fades.` at 21:03:14 (span A), and everything after it — the DoT ticks, the
// stone spider, all of it — is other people's combat, which is exactly what a reconnect
// preamble also carries. So the one-span window this fixture used to be contained no in-world
// evidence at all and could no longer date the absence.
//
// The join is HONEST rather than convenient: replaying the WHOLE 1.6M-line log through the real
// detector puts this login's `fromTs` at 21:03:14 too (measured 2026-08-12), because the 64
// minutes the join skips contain nothing that names the character. The fixture answers what the
