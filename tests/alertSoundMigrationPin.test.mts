// ============================================================================
// alertSoundMigrationPin.test.mts — JOS-272 (v): the fleet-wide alert-sound rewrite has a lock on it.
// ============================================================================
//
// WHAT `ALERT_SOUND_MIGRATION_VERSION` ACTUALLY IS. It reads like a version number and it is a
// SWITCH. `store.ts migrateStoredAlertSounds` runs the retired-pack rewrite on the first
// `getAlerts()` after the stamp in a user's store falls behind the constant — so bumping the
// constant by one re-runs `migrateAlertSounds` on EVERY install that has ever run this app, against
// whatever `LEGACY_ALERT_PACK_IDS` and the category mapping say at that moment. Every alert pointing
// into a listed pack is re-pointed at the shipped default, and the stamp records only that the
// rewrite ran, never what it did. There is no undo.
//
// That is a legitimate thing to want — a pack really can be retired later — and it is never a thing
// to do incidentally. Two ways it could happen by accident, both closed here:
//
//   1. THE BUMP ITSELF, made while changing something adjacent (the constant sits four lines under
//      the list it governs). The version is frozen below, so a bump is a red suite and therefore a
//      sentence somebody has to write in a commit message.
//   2. THE MAPPING MOVING UNDER A STORE THAT IS NOT YET STAMPED. Every user who has never run the
//      migration runs whatever the table says on the day they upgrade. The whole input → output
//      table is frozen below, verbatim, so a "harmless" re-point of one category cannot be made
//      without stating it.
//
// AND THE STAMP SEMANTICS THEMSELVES. `alertSoundMigrationPending` was extracted out of store.ts for
// this suite (JOS-272): store.ts imports Electron, the predicate does not, and "a store already
// stamped is never rewritten again" is the property the whole design rests on — including for a
// store stamped by a NEWER build, which an older build must never walk backwards.
//
// This is a PINNING suite. It asserts today's values on purpose. When a change here is deliberate,
// change these numbers in the same commit and say why.
