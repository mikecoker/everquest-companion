// JOS-118 — A TRACKED INSTANCE EXISTS ONLY ONCE THE SPELL LANDS ON A NAMED TARGET.
//
// THE DEFECT: owner validation of the buff/debuff overlay found a debuff bar appearing for a
// spell that was RESISTED. The cause was not the resist handling (there was none) but the
// optimistic display on the other side: `castBegin` opened a `provisional` ActiveBuff bound to
// a target the model INFERRED, retracted only by a fizzle or an interrupt. A resist is neither,
// so the bar stayed — and fifteen seconds later the same guess was promoted to a solid row plus
// an open cast that could pair into a duration sample.
//
// THE RULE, one shape for buffs, debuffs and crowd control alike (mez and slow ARE debuffs;
// buffs land on individuals too, so none of them is a special case):
//
//   An instance opens ONLY on a line that CONFIRMS the landing, keyed to the entity that line
//   NAMES. Never a cast, never an inferred or "current" target, never a resist.
//
// So the resist case is correct BY CONSTRUCTION: there was never anything to retract. These
// tests pin both halves — that a resisted/unconfirmed cast shows nothing and mints nothing, and
// that a real landing still produces the row it should, keyed to the right entity — because a
// fix that only deleted things would pass the first half and break the product.
//
// THE OWNERSHIP GATES ARE PINNED HERE TOO (owner: "make sure we're only capturing our
// buffs/debuffs - not others"). They pre-date this ticket — `onBuffApply`'s own-cast gate
// (Task #45) and the CC hold's own-cast requirement (JOS-89) — and unifying the world model
// must not have weakened either, so all three shapes get an explicit regression pin.
//
// EVERY SENTENCE BELOW IS A SHAPE THE REAL LOG PRINTS, verbatim from the tree or the owner's
// own log, with only names/timestamps substituted (the reporter-slice precedent):
//   `You feel much faster.`                        w1-current-session.log  (self haste landing)
//   `Darmoss feels much faster.`                   w1-current-session.log  (the SAME message
//                                                   naming another person — a group buff landing
//                                                   on an individual who is not you)
