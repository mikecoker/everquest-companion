// Graphics compatibility (src/shared/graphicsPrefs.ts + the 9→10 / 10→11 store migrations) —
// JOS-40, JOS-31.
//
// The claim under test is a claim about machines nobody here owns: a player's RTX 5080 turned the
// transparent, always-on-top overlays into black-screen artifacting (JOS-40), and a player under
// Wine watched the celebration overlay become a stuck black box after a level-up (JOS-31, report
// 01KZGQZJ2HMZGRY28A7CVRG4QT). Neither can be reproduced here. So what ships is a switch and a
// detection, and what this suite pins is exactly what a Windows machine CAN pin: that each switch
// means one thing, that nothing turns itself on unless the environment asked, that an explicit
// preference beats the environment IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, that a store written by any past build
// arrives with a complete block, and that the env door opens on the spellings a support reply
// would actually give and on nothing else.
//
// The environment READING is not here — that is tests/wineDetect.test.mts, and the seam between
// them is the point: this module takes two booleans and does not know what looked at the machine.
//
// No Electron, no store file: shared/graphicsPrefs.ts is a zero-import pure module by design, so
// this suite is as cheap and as unskippable as overlayLayout/updateCadence.
