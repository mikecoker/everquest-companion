// THE CLIENT SPELL TABLE'S FIELD MAP, PINNED (JOS-382).
//
// `spells_us.txt` is Daybreak's file and is never committed here, so the rows below are authored —
// but every one of them is a VERBATIM transcription of the fields this parser reads out of the
// owner's real install, taken on 2026-08-16 and named beside each row. That is the only honest way
// to pin a field map against a file the repo may not carry: a test that requires the client
// install would skip on CI and pin nothing.
//
// AND IT PINS ONE CORRECTION TO THE BRIEF. An effect slot is
// `slot | effectId | base | limit | CALC | MAX`, not `… | max | calc`. Tashani's slot 2 reads
// `2|50|-10|0|101|23`; Torven's table documents Tashani at -23 magic resist and calc 101 is
// "base plus level/2, capped at max". Read the other way round, the formula code would be 23
// (which is not a formula) and the cap would be 101 (a number Tashani has never produced).
// Malaisement confirms it at -40 on all four axes, and Mesmerization puts its documented
// "up to level 55" in the same position.
//
// JOS-396 ADDS TWO MORE FIELDS AND THE SAME RULE APPLIES TO THEM. Fields 11 and 12 are the buff
// duration formula and its cap, and Odium's row (id 4093, transcribed below) is the measurement:
// `11 = 7`, `12 = 5`, five ticks, thirty seconds — the duration the wiki's own Odium page states
// and the duration the game's spell window prints. What the parser does with them is nothing:
// it records the two numbers and the effect-0 slots beside them, and every evaluation happens at
// a READER'S level in shared/spellMetrics.ts.
//
// JOS-444 ADDS FIELD 10, THE RE-USE TIMER, AND ITS DECOY SITS RIGHT BESIDE IT. Field 9 is the
// RECOVERY time and reads 1500 on 18,008 of the owner's 33,952 playable rows, so a spell whose
// recast happens to be 1.5s — Garrison's Mighty Mana Shock, below — cannot tell the two columns
// apart on its own. Odium can: field 9 is 1500 and field 10 is 6000, and the wiki's own
// `recast_time` for Odium is six seconds. Complete Heal closes it from the other side (field 9 =
// 1500, field 10 = 0), and all three rows are transcribed below.
