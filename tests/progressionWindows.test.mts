// GOLDEN-WINDOW PROGRESSION TESTS — WL40–WL45 (docs/plans/leveling-analytics.md).
//
// METHODOLOGY (AGENTS.md): every window is a VERBATIM span of the user's real log, cut by
// tests/extract-progression-fixtures.mjs through the shared scrub, hand-read line by line, and
// replayed through the REAL parseEvent + EpochDetector + ProgressionModule before `rangeStats`
// is called over hand-chosen bounds. The expectations below are what a human counted in the
// fixture (`grep -c` on the committed file), not what the code happened to produce.
//
//   WL40  the farm run (Sun Aug 02 15:12→17:33) — ten dings, dense stated percentages. The
//         load-bearing arithmetic: Σ percent between consecutive dings ≈ 1.0 level.
//   WL41  three zones with kills in each (Sat Aug 01 13:38→14:11) — per-zone rows, self-vs-pet
//         credit, and the Σ-identities across a real travel hop.
//   WL42  idle (Mon Aug 03 00:55→14:31) — a 13-minute break AND a 12.6-hour silence.
//   WL43  AT THE CAP (Fri Jul 31 17:51→18:56) — 21 exp lines, not one of them stating a
//         percentage. THE regression: nothing may render 0.0% or a fabricated rate.
//   WL44  the loadout swap (Fri Jul 31 16:19 level 50 → Sun Aug 02 02:26 level 13) — the run
//         split, and no rate fabricated across the unlogged drop.
//   WL45  kill credit (Thu Jul 30 16:28→16:56) — all three shapes in one zone.
//
// Plus a FULL-LOG tripwire asserting IDENTITIES and floors only (the log is live and grows;
// frozen counts rot — AND SO DO RATIOS whose denominator is the owner's play, which is what
// JOS-241 re-derived identity 5 below out of; tests/progressionJoin.mts carries the conditioning),
// skipped when the real log is absent (CI).

  //    farms greys, which print no experience line at all, so the numerator grew and the
  //    denominator did not. Measured share of credited kills that HAD a line to claim: 87-100%
  //    per day through 2026-08-10, then 6.1% and 2.0%. The ratio was measuring the owner's con
  //    colour. Widening the bound would only have bought a few more evenings of it.

  //    derives both from the columns): the credited kills that had an experience line to claim,
  //    and the experience lines that had a credited kill to pay. Those are the two directions of
  //    one relation, so their sizes agree exactly to the degree the join is one-to-one — and a

  //    which is what stops the number tracking how the owner spent his evening.

  //      • the at-cap experience line pushed to the column twice → 5443/6334 — the ratio, downward
  //      • self kills counted twice ONLY after 2026-08-11 → recent 500/476 — the RECENT clause
