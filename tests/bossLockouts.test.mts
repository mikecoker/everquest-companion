// THIS WEEK'S LOCKOUTS (JOS-74) — the lockout window's arithmetic, and a golden over real kill
// history straddling a Tuesday reset.
//
// WHAT IS BEING PINNED. A raid boss's weekly LOOT lockout is per boss per difficulty and resets
// on a Pacific wall clock (the sources are cited in the header of
// src/renderer/src/features/bosses/lockout.ts, along with which of the two constants is
// double-sourced and which still wants verifying in game). Nothing about it is parsed: the app
// already records, per mob and per instance tier, when your most recent CREDITED kill landed, so
// "locked this week" is a comparison and the only hard part is the boundary.
//
// THE BOUNDARY IS THE SUBJECT. It is a PACIFIC WALL-CLOCK instant, so it is 15:00 UTC for half
// the year and 16:00 UTC for the other half, and a user in Tokyo must get the same two instants a
// user in Denver does. Hence: DST in both directions, the exact-boundary kill, a week over a
// month/year edge, and the same `now` recomputed under five machine timezones.
//
// THIS FILE PINS THE PROCESS TIMEZONE (below) because the second half replays REAL log lines, and
// an EQ timestamp parses to a LOCAL epoch (`parseEqTimestamp`) — so "Tue Aug 04 22:55:08" is a
// different instant on a machine in Tokyo, and the golden would be asserting the test machine's
// zone rather than the app's arithmetic. node:test runs each file in its own process, so the pin
// is this file's alone.
//
// Run: `npm test`.

// OWNER DECISION, 2026-08-09: a raid target carries FIVE weekly lockouts, d0 through d4, and the
// owner clears all five most weeks. Section 4 above is what that looked like when the app could
// not tell a base instance from the open world — a base rung it drew as an outline and hedged
// about in a tooltip. This section is the two halves of the distinction, both cut verbatim from
// the owner's log on the same three days.
//
//   THE LADDER RUN (tests/fixtures/bosstier-hate-ladder-aug01.log). Sat Aug 01, one boss, one
//   afternoon, five instances entered in order:
//     13:07:45  The Plane of Hate - Solo.                → d0, the BASE instance
//     13:38:00  The Plane of Hate - Solo 1 (Awakened).   → d1
//     13:57:08  The Plane of Hate - Solo 2 (Adaptive).   → d2
//     14:35:15  The Plane of Hate - Solo 3 (Fused).      → d3
//     15:33:26  The Plane of Hate - Solo 4 (Refined).    → d4
//   …with a credited Maestro of Rancor kill inside each. FIVE GREEN RUNGS is the acceptance
//   criterion of this ticket, and before it the first of those five kills was indistinguishable
//   from an open-world kill of the same boss in the same zone.
//
//   THE OPEN WORLD (tests/fixtures/boss-open-world-hate.log). The same zone with no suffix, two
//   credited Master of Spite kills — one before the Tue Aug 04 reset and one after, so whichever
//   week you stand in, one of them is inside it and neither greens anything.
