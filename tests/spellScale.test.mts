// THE MOTE-RANK DAMAGE FIT (JOS-447) — the log measurements the rule was fitted to, kept as
// fixtures so the fit can be re-argued rather than trusted.
//
// ── THE METHOD, NAMED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Source: the owner's own combat log, `eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt`, 2,406,300 lines covering
// 2026-07-19 to 2026-08-23. Mined by a throwaway `scripts/_mineSpellRanks.mts` (deleted with the
// ticket, per the repo's diagnose-then-delete rule), which:
//
//   1. streamed the file IN ORDER, tracking the character level off
//      `You have gained a level! Welcome to level N!` — 193 of them over an 11..50 span, because
//      the loadout system re-levels, so LEVEL is part of every bucket key and not a constant;
//   2. tracked the rank of the LAST CAST of each spell line — `You begin casting <Name> VIII.` puts
//      the next hit at rank 8 and an UNSUFFIXED cast line puts it at base. Attribution is the cast
//      and never the merge: the owner merged a `Discordant Mind II` on 2026-07-30 and went on
//      casting the base for a week, and a merge-attributed miner reads that as "rank II does
//      nothing";
//   3. bucketed every `You hit X for N points of <type> damage by <Spell>.` by
//      (spell line, rank, level), keeping `(Critical)` hits apart, and kept the MAXIMUM. Partial
//      resists only ever subtract, so the maximum of a well-sampled bucket is the unresisted hit.
//
// ── WHY THE FIT IS ON RATIOS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A logged hit is not a base figure: the owner's worn gear multiplies it, and the factor MOVES.
// Measured on BASE-RANK casts against the client's own `|base| + step x level` capped at `|max|`
// (spells_us.txt effect-0 slot), it is ~1.017 in the July windows and ~1.2216 in the August ones —
// Chaos Flux 178/175 and Anarchy 280/275 on 2026-07-29, against Shock of Lightning, Lightning Bolt,
// Flame Shock, Spirit Tap and base-rank Garrison's all reading 1.219..1.222 on 2026-08-06 and
// 2026-08-21. This app models none of that and says so (spellMetrics.ts: no crits, focus, AA,
// spell-damage bonus or resist).
//
// So the rule is read off the RATIO between two ranks of ONE spell in windows whose worn factor is
// the same, where the factor cancels. That is what `RANK_PAIRS` below is.
//
// ── AND WHAT IT OVERTURNED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The ticket's hypothesis was the item engine's damage rule — ten percent a rank. The pairs put the
// rank-VIII multiplier at 1.4787, which is `1 + 8 x 0.06`, and every one of the six is the FLOOR of
// that product rather than the ceiling. Ten percent is not close: it predicts 599 or 600 for the
// owner's Garrison's where the fit predicts 492, and the 600 he reads in his own log is
// `floor(492 x 1.2216)` — the fitted figure wearing the same worn factor his base-rank casts wear.

 * second spell at a second rank. `low`/`high` are maximum non-critical hits; `n` counts the
 * non-critical hits in the bucket.
 *
 * Garrison's Mighty Mana Shock: cast at BASE on 2026-08-06 while a fresh loadout climbed 19..24,
 * and at VIII on 2026-08-21 while another climbed the same levels. Both windows read 1.219..1.222
 * of the client's own magnitude on base-rank spells, so the worn factor cancels in the ratio.
 *
 * Discordant Mind: base on 2026-07-30 at level 43 (472 over 47 hits, 1.2196 of the client's 387)
 * and II from 2026-08-01 (528 over 272 hits) — the same worn factor, two ranks apart.

 *
 * HIS LOG SAYS 600, and the two are the same claim. Over 1,280 non-critical hits across nine
 * separate level buckets on 2026-08-22 (levels 34..42, 150/261/104/156/149/112/110/170/41 hits) the
 * maximum is exactly 600 every single time, with 596, 592, 586 and 581 below it as partial resists.
 * The worn factor is bounded from the base-rank casts themselves: the six 2026-08-06 buckets pin it
 * to [1.22143, 1.22183) (`floor(280g) = 342` binds from below, `floor(284g) = 346` from above, over
 * client bases of 280 and 284) and Spirit Tap in the 2026-08-21/22 sessions agrees at
 * [1.21905, 1.22381) over its own base of 210. Anywhere in
 * that band `floor(492 x g)` is 600, and 493 — the ceiling — would need g below 1.21907, which the
 * base-rank casts exclude. The ten-percent rule would have printed 599 and looked right by accident.
