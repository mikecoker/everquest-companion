// ============================================================================
// errorNoise.test.mts — an error report should mean an error (JOS-133).
// ============================================================================
//
// THE READING THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR, and it is one number: over 14 days the error store's only
// recurring user-cohort issue was fingerprint f38d9cf19743f81b with 17,632 occurrences across
// 0.13.0 and 0.14.0 — roughly two thirds of every `mainErrorLogLines` the fleet has ever counted.
// It was not an error. An image the app wanted could not be downloaded, the renderer hid it, and
// the app carried on exactly as designed. A counter that large made of one handled condition does
// not describe this app's health; it hides it.
//
// TWO CHANGES, ONE ARGUMENT, and this file covers both because they only make sense together:
//
//   A. THE CACHE MISS BECOMES A COUNTER. The network leg of an image fetch bumps
//      `imageFetchFailures` and warns once per host per session, instead of filing an error. The
//      HTTP-STATUS branch beside it stays an error, and the difference is the whole point: a host
//      that never answered is somebody else's outage, a host that answered 404 means this app
//      asked for something that is not there.
//   B. IDENTICAL LINES ARE CAPPED. The first five copies of one line are written as always; after
//      that one notice replaces the next and the rest become `suppressedErrorLines`. The counter is
//      what makes the cap allowable at all — `mainErrorLogLines + suppressedErrorLines` is still
//      exactly how many times the thing happened, so a build that starts looping cannot look like a
//      build that got better.
//
// A THIRD CASE JOINED THEM (JOS-266) and is covered where it belongs — the cache-read failure that
// heals itself lives in `tests/imageCacheHeal.test.mts`, because it is a behaviour of the request
// path rather than of the error funnel. What is asserted HERE is the two decisions this file owns
// for every demotion: that the field is exempt from the release error rate, and that TELEMETRY.md
// says what the counter means.
//
// WHAT IS DRIVEN AND WHAT IS PINNED. `errorRepeat` and the image-cache warn gate are LEAVES (they
// import nothing, or nothing but other leaves), so this suite drives the real production code with
// no Electron in the process — `tests/errorCounterHygiene.test.mts`'s technique, for its reason.
// The WIRING inside `logError` needs `electron`, so it is pinned as source there and in
// `tests/healthCounters.test.mts`, which owns the counter half.
