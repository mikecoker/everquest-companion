// Pure unit tests for the DPS curve's hover geometry
// (src/renderer/src/features/combat/dpsChart.ts).
//
// No log, no fixture, no DOM — so this file never skips. It pins the things this hover can get
// quietly wrong, every one of them invisible until someone points at a tick and is told about a
// different one:
//   1. `tAtUserX` is the EXACT inverse of `xAtT`, the mapping the markers are placed with. If the
//      two drift, a marker hovered at its own pixel resolves to somebody else's instant.
//   2. `preserveAspectRatio="none"` means CSS px are NOT viewBox units on this chart — the whole
//      reason a raw `clientX - rect.left` is wrong here, and the reason a "5 px" grab radius has
//      to be converted rather than multiplied in.
//   3. The hover DOT reads the drawn polyline's own vertices, so it rides the line instead of
//      floating beside it — including at the clamped edges and on a one-bucket fight.
//   4. `placeMarkers` DROPS what scrolled out of a live window rather than clamping it to the
//      edge, so the hover population is exactly what the chart drew.
//   5. ONE TIME BASE: markers and curve share `{t0, t1}`. A marker at a bucket's centre lands on
//      that bucket's own drawn vertex, and a live window advances in WHOLE buckets — the two pins
//      for the reported jitter, where an exact-time marker mapping was scaled against a
//      wall-clock right edge while the curve only moved when a bucket completed.
