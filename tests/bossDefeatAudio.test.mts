// THE BOSS-DEFEAT SOUND FIRES ON EVERY KILL (owner, 2026-08-04: "every time is worth
// celebrating").
//
// WHAT IT USED TO BE. Task #24 split boss detection in two: `bossKills` (any kill, including a
// repeat at the same instance tier) drove the confetti, the card flash and the snackbar, while a
// narrower `newDefeats` (first kill at a NEW tier) drove the `bossDefeat` app signal — the
// alert sound — alone. The consequence was a screen that cheered and a room that stayed quiet:
// kill Lord Nagafen on Tuesday and again on Thursday and only Tuesday made a sound. The gate was
// a first-time-only SIGNAL EMISSION, not a def-level dedupe and not the celebrations law.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOW. One predicate — `bossKills` — behind confetti, snackbar AND sound. `newDefeats`
// is gone rather than left unused, because a second defeat predicate sitting in the file is how
// the split grows back. Rate limiting is the alert's own `cooldownMs`, applied by `fireAppSignal`.
//
// WHAT CHANGED UNDER IT (2026-08-05): that predicate now compares the CREDITED kill count rather
// than the raw one, so a boss killed by a stranger in open world is tracked and celebrated by
// nobody. Every kill in this file is yours, which is why every assertion below reads the same as
// it always did; the credit rule itself is pinned in tests/bossCreditedKills.test.mts.
//
// WHAT DID NOT CHANGE, and must not: the BASELINE. The celebrations law (AGENTS.md) is about
// replay vs live, not first vs every — a character switch re-hydrates every historical kill and
// must celebrate none of them. `useBossKills` seeds `prevRef` silently on the first snapshot and
// only compares afterwards; T3 below pins that guard is still in the source.
//
// Run: `npm test`.
