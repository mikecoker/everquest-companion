// Store schema migration 4 → 5: the cursor ring + overlay auto-hide prefs blobs.
//
// A companion to `storeMigrations.test.mts`, which owns the framework itself (the chain's
// integrity, the file half, the failure/downgrade policy) and steps 1→4. That file is at the
// repo's 400-code-line factoring ceiling, so a new step gets its own file rather than a widened
// threshold — the same call `PreferencesView.tsx` makes when a section becomes its own factory.
//
// WHAT THIS STEP PROMISES. After it runs, `cursorRing` and `overlayAutoHide` are present and
// every value in them is one this build understands. It never invents intent: the ring ships
// OFF (it costs a window plus an 8 ms poll), only the uncontroversial half of auto-hide ships
// ON, and a value the user already set is repaired field by field rather than replaced.
//
// The clamps themselves belong to `shared/presencePrefs.ts` and are pinned in
// `presence.test.mts`; what is asserted here is that the MIGRATION runs them, and that it adds
// without editing anything the user already had.
