// COMBAT VIEW PREFERENCES — the vocabulary behind two owner rulings.
//
// JOS-115 moved the You / Group / Everyone meter scope off every combat surface and into one
// persisted preference; JOS-116 made the DRILL a persisted preference too, so switching tabs stops
// throwing away where you were. Both live in `features/combat/combatPrefs.ts`, which is DOM-free
// on purpose — the hooks around it (useCombatPrefs.ts) only move strings in and out of
// localStorage, and everything that can silently go wrong is here: a default, a guard, a degrade.
//
// WHAT IS WORTH PINNING, and why each one is not obvious:
//   * the DEFAULT scope is Everyone (JOS-229; it was Group from JOS-115 until then), and an ABSENT
//     key is that default. A user who has never opened Preferences has chosen nothing, and the
//     answer a meter gives them must not depend on an inferred roster being complete.
//   * …and the flip is FRESH-STATE ONLY. A stored 'group' is an answer somebody gave and comes
//     back verbatim — the default speaks for absence and for nothing else, which is why there is
//     no migration here to test.
//   * anything that is not one of the three degrades to the default. A meter is never blank
//     because a value was hand-edited or written by a future build.
//   * a stored drill is TOTAL: absent, empty, malformed JSON, an array, an unknown arm and a
//     missing id all land on level 1 — the JOS-105 degrade rule, one step earlier than usual.
//   * "level 1, nothing expanded" is written as an ABSENT KEY, so a fresh install and an explicit
//     un-drill leave the store in exactly the same state.
//   * changing the drilled SUBJECT drops the expanded abilities (they name bars in the old
//     subject's list); re-drilling the SAME subject keeps them.
//   * JOS-240 gave the entity arm an OPTIONAL `name` so a drill can survive a fight change even
//     when the row's id was minted per spawn. Optional is the load-bearing word: every token in
//     an existing user's localStorage lacks it and must read exactly as it always did, and an
//     empty or non-string name degrades to "resolve by id", never to level 1.
//
// The OTHER half of the degrade — a drill this build can read but the current fight cannot
// RESOLVE — is `petRows.meterPanel`'s and is pinned in tests/combatPetNesting.test.mts. Nothing
// here duplicates it; this file's job is the shape that reaches the builder.
//
// No window, no React, no Electron — this suite can never skip.
