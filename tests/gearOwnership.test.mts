// ============================================================================
// THE GEAR TAB'S OWNERSHIP JOIN (JOS-285, Gear Planner phase 4) — own it, where, at what +N.
// ============================================================================
//
// The join itself is a `Map.get`, and there is nothing to test in that. What IS worth pinning is
// every DECISION the join makes on the way to a cell, because each one is a sentence a player will
// read as a fact about their own bags:
//
//   * a `+2` in the bank and a base copy equipped are TWO facts and must render as two;
//   * an `<Item> (Exaltation)` row is a GEM MADE FROM the item, not a copy of it — the owner's own
//     dump has four, and one of them (Golden Efreeti Boots) is the item's ONLY appearance;
//   * a key ring this app does not count is "not counted", which is not "not owned";
//   * looted-with-no-copy is its own answer, and it never restates the dump's age.
//
// TWO INPUTS, the `plannerOwnership.test.mts` arrangement:
//
//   * HAND-WRITTEN ROWS, for the shapes and orderings a fold can produce — cheap, exhaustive, and
//     honest about being synthetic.
//   * THE REAL 295-line dump (`tests/fixtures/Primitive_freeport-Inventory.txt`) through the REAL
//     parser and the REAL fold, for the claims that must hold against bytes the game wrote: the
//     `(Exaltation)`-only item, the `Activated` row the fold leaves out, and the exact cell text
//     for a weapon the owner is wearing at +5.
//
// The corpus is NOT loaded here. This file is about the join, and `tests/gearIndex.test.mts` is
// where the corpus's own numbers are asserted — so a rescrape turns THAT file red and names the
// corpus, rather than this one going red and blaming the join.
//
// Run: `npm test`.
