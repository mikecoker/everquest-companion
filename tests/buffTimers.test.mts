// THE BUFFS/TIMER OVERLAY's entry model, pinned to real bytes (JOS-89).

//
// Ten user reports converge on this surface and the loudest ask in all of them is the one this
// file exists to prove: chain-mez four or five enemies and see a NAMED COUNTDOWN PER ENEMY. The
// owner's own log already contains that exact sequence, so nothing here is authored — every
// assertion below is read off `tests/fixtures/w10-cazic-slow.log`, a scrubbed excerpt of a real
// Plane of Fear pull, replayed through the real parser + the real BuffsModule + the real
// BuffTimersModule and out through the real projection.
//
// THE LAW UNDER TEST: a duration spells.json STATES becomes a receding countdown; a duration
// nobody states becomes elapsed time counting UP; an invented remaining is never displayed.
