// CombatSnapshot.currentTarget — the mob in front of you, exposed as a FACT.
//
// World-model law 6 gives fight naming two halves: a LIVE fight is named after the CURRENT
// target (the most recent outgoing target — the mob you are presently swinging at), and on
// FINALIZE the name switches to the LARGEST target ("most damage absorbed", a labeled proxy,
// because the log has no HP). `SegmentSummary.name` composes that with a '+N others' suffix,
// so it is a SENTENCE. `currentTarget` is the fact underneath it: the raw mob name, the
// others count, and the encounter's last-damage ts — the shape a mob lookup can consume
// without regex-stripping '+N' back out of a display string (law 2 — canonicalize at
// boundaries, display raw).
//
// The three things this pins:
//   1. It is the MOST RECENT outgoing target, never the largest. Those genuinely differ
//      mid-pull, and the largest-target rule must not leak backwards into a live fight.
//   2. `others` = distinct engaged targets − 1 (the same count the '+N' suffix shows).
//   3. It is UNDEFINED whenever the answer is not known: no encounter open (between pulls,
//      and after finalize), or an encounter that opened on the mob hitting YOU first and has
//      not yet taken an outgoing hit. Never a guess (law 1).
//
// THE WINDOW — tests/fixtures/w24-multi-mob-no-split.log, the same committed multi-mob pull
// Task #55's segmentation window uses (Soldier of V`Zher + Baron Telyx V`Zher, Sun Aug 02
// 15:30:23 → 15:32:17, extracted through tests/fixture-scrub.mjs by
// tests/extract-combat-fixtures.mjs). Hand-read, the beats this test stands on:
//   15:30:39  the pull OPENS on incoming damage — "Soldier of V`Zher slashes YOU for 25".
//             Your only outgoing line in that second is a MISS, which carries no target.
//   15:30:40  the Baron joins, also with incoming damage. Still no outgoing hit.
//   15:30:41  your first landed swing: "You slash Soldier of V`Zher for 85 points of damage."
//   15:30:41 → 15:31:09  every outgoing hit lands on the Soldier (1476 damage over 33 hits).
//   15:31:12 → 15:32:00  every outgoing hit lands on the Baron (2303 over 54 hits).
// So anywhere in 15:31:12..15:31:48 the current target is the BARON while the largest target
// is still the SOLDIER — the Baron only passes 1476 cumulative at 15:31:49. That divergence
// window is what makes assertion 1 meaningful on real data.
