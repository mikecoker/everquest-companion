/**
 * ============================================================================
 * foldArm.mts — WHERE THE STARTUP FOLD GOES, microsecond by microsecond (JOS-55).
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The measured fact this exists to break down: the parser alone folds the owner's 1.4M-event log
 * at ~565k events/sec (1.8 us/event) while the whole pipeline manages ~32k (31 us/event). About
 * 94% of a startup replay happens DOWNSTREAM of the parser, and until this file nothing said in
 * which consumer. `replay.bench.mts` prints the table this produces; JOS-56 bisects with it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FOLD RUNS IN THE BENCH'S OWN PROCESS, not in the app it launches.
 *   The instrumentation is a parameter — `registry.attach(bus, timer)` and `new LogBus(probe)` —
 *   for exactly the reason `replaySlicer.ts` states about its own seam: an environment variable
 *   that installs a per-event profiler on a real startup is a knob a support answer will
 *   eventually recommend. A parameter is visible to this file and to nobody else. But a parameter
 *   can only be passed by a caller in the same process, and the bench cannot reach inside the
 *   Electron app it launches. So the Electron arm stays exactly what it was (wall clock, duty,
 *   block probe, the budgets), and the ATTRIBUTION arm folds the same log here, through the same
 *   modules, in the same order.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES "THE SAME MODULES" TRUE RATHER THAN CLAIMED: `src/main/modules/wiring.ts` owns the
 *   construction and the registration order, and pipeline.ts — the app's composition root — is its
 *   other caller. A module added to the app is folded here without anyone remembering to update a
 *   list. The bus, the combat engine, the epoch and offline-gap detectors are wired below in the
 *   order pipeline.ts and index.ts wire them, and that order IS the delivery order.
 *
 * WHAT IS HONESTLY DIFFERENT, because a profiler that hides its own distortions is worthless:
 *   * No Electron. Same V8, same code, but no renderer, no IPC, no protocol handlers and no
 *     window competing for the main thread. The Electron arm's `events/sec folding` is printed
 *     beside this arm's rate so the two can be compared rather than confused.
 *   * No duty cycle (`unchunkedSlicer()`): this arm measures the fold's SPEED, not the throttle.
 *   * The two knowledge lookups (item, mob) are absent and the alert defs are empty. All three are
 *     LIVE-only paths — a historical replay never calls them — but say so rather than imply they
 *     were measured.
 *   * The user's learned message overlay lives in userData, which is Electron's to find; this arm
 *     seeds the miner with the committed baseline alone. It changes which cast messages the parser
 *     recognizes at the margin, not the shape of the fold.
