// GOLDEN-WINDOW LOOT TEST — W14 (Task #40): Plane of Sky currency / auto-sell loot.
//
// METHODOLOGY (same as goldenWindows.test.mts): a real log span was READ LINE-BY-LINE and
// extracted verbatim into tests/fixtures/w14-sky-currency-loot.log. The window is tonight's
// Sky session, Sat Aug 01 ~22:54:55–23:03:00 (raw eqlog lines ~952259–954852). It is replayed
// through the REAL parser + LootModule and the resulting loot snapshot is asserted.
//
// What the window pins:
//   - `You looted <rune> … and stored it in your currency` (NO trailing period) parses as a
//     loot event with disposition:'currency' and the correct source — these Wind Runes are
//     Plane of Sky QUEST items that were NEVER parsed before (so Sky quest progress silently
//     missed every currency-routed rune).
//   - `You looted <item> … and sold it for free.` (trailing period) parses as disposition:'sold'.
//   - the ordinary `--You have looted a Sphinx Claw +1 …--` dashed form is UNCHANGED (no
//     disposition) and still parses.
//   - the LootModule carries `disposition` through onto its snapshot rows.
//   - QUEST COUNTING: currency-routed Wind Runes COUNT toward held (they are quest items in
//     posky.json), while 'sold' items do NOT count as held — asserted through the SAME
//     held-count + reconcile rule production uses (reconcile()), so this is the real behavior.
//
// Run: `npm test`.
