// GOLDEN WINDOW — THE UPGRADED PET, AND THE BUFF THAT NAMES IT (JOS-188).
//
// THE REPORT (01KZPFBMF1R26DSG0R2EGER7MV, app 0.18.0): *"It appears if you change pets, they stop
// showing up in the damage meter (i upgraded from level 10 water elemental to level 14). i tried
// relogging, but it did not resolve."*
//
// THE CHARACTERIZATION, from that reporter's own 2,446-line slice, replayed through this engine
// before the fix: the JOS-54 succession law never FAILED — it never ran. Succession is triggered
// by the successor's own claim, and an upgraded summon produces none.
//
//   11:26:22  `Zarer says, 'As you wish, oh great one.'`     the outgoing pet (a petSay, inert)
//   11:26:25  `You begin casting Minor Summoning: Water.`    the upgrade
//   11:26:34  `You begin casting Burnout.`                   a `targetType: Pet` spell
//   11:26:40  `Jabektik goes berserk.`                       the landing NAMES the new pet
//   11:26:50  `Jabektik backstabs Footman of V`Zher …`       89 hits / 3,385 points follow
//
// `told you, '… Master.'` tells in that whole 30-minute window: ZERO. `/pet who leader` answers:
// ZERO. So the replay ended with `petDisplayNames() === []` and one row, You — the predecessor's
// frozen row is only there for the reporter because a tell bound it earlier in the session, and
// relogging cannot help because relogging prints no binding line either. It is JOS-47's accepted
// blind spot reached by a new road: `world.claim()` binds a NAME, and an upgrade changes it.
//
// THE THIRD BINDING SIGNAL. 40 spells in the DB are `targetType: Pet`, the game will not let one
// land on anything but your own pet, and `You begin casting <Spell>.` is printed for the player
// and nobody else — the same exclusivity Task #65's charm model already runs on. So an own cast
// of a pet-only spell ARMS (charmModel.armWindowMs: the spell's own cast time plus slack) and the
// named landing that resolves it binds the pet, through the SAME `bindPetClaim` the tell and the
// leader say go through. It is the first of the three that costs the player nothing: you buff the
// pet you just summoned because you were going to anyway.
//
// MEASURED, owner's whole log (1,557,569 lines, 2026-08-10): 19 binds, 14 distinct names, and
// EVERY one of the 14 is a name a `… Master.'` tell also bound — nothing is bound by this rule
// alone and nothing it binds is later contradicted. In all 14 the buff arrives FIRST, by 81 s to
// 2,528 s, and the damage that lands in those gaps is 1,865 hits / 27,088 points the meter throws
// away without it (Giber alone: 947 hits / 11,636 points across a 42-minute gap).
//
// THE FIXTURE is the owner's own instance of the report — a reporter's slice never becomes one
// (AGENTS.md). p3-pet-upgraded-buff-bound.log, Sun Jul 19 21:06–21:12, Oggok:
//
//   21:06:26  `Vebann told you, 'Attacking Lost Crusader Master.'`   the predecessor, ordered
//   21:09:29  `You begin casting Haunting Corpse.`                   the upgrade
//   21:09:55  `You begin casting Intensify Death.`                   the pet-only spell
//   21:10:02  `Vabantik's eyes gleam with madness.`                  the successor, named
//   21:12:31  `Vabantik told you, 'Attacking an ogre guard Master.'` the tell, 149 s late
//
// THE SPELL DB IS INSTALLED HERE and is not optional: the named landing is a `buffApply`, which
// is DB-gated (shared/logEvents.ts BuffApplyEvent) and does not exist without it. Node runs each
// test file in its own process, so this injection cannot reach petClaimWindows.test.mts beside it
// — which deliberately runs WITHOUT a DB and whose numbers are therefore untouched by this rung.
//
// Fixture-guarded: `read` returns [] when the file is absent and every fixture test skips.

//
// THE CHARACTERIZATION, from the reporter's own 6,544-line slice replayed through this engine: the
// rung above never fired, and NOT because anything dropped the bind. Summoned pets have no time
// limit — they end by death, loadout swap or dismissal — and nothing in the engine expires a
// confirmed claim, so there was no binding-DROP rule to fix. There was never a bind at all. The
// slice's whole ownership evidence is one re-summon and one pet-only buff:
//
//   16:15:45  `Kastik says, 'As you wish, oh great one.'`   the outgoing pet (a petSay, inert)
//   16:15:54  `You begin casting Guardian Spirit.`          the re-summon
//   16:16:08  `You summon a guardian spirit.`               a SELF landing — arms nothing
//   16:16:21  `You begin casting Tiny Companion.`           a `targetType: Pet` spell — ARMS
//   16:16:25  `Zarober shrinks.`                            the landing that NAMES the new pet
//
// `… Master.'` tells: ZERO. `/pet who leader` answers: ZERO. So this is JOS-188's reported defect
// exactly — a re-summon nobody announces — and the pair that was built to catch it is right there
// in the log, four seconds apart, inside the DB's own 4 s cast time.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG WAS THE DB, ONE SUBJECT TOKEN WIDE. `petBuffLanding` requires the armed spell to be
// AMONG the landing's candidates (the message is not the gate — ` shrinks.` is also Ant Legs and
// Shrink), and the scrape wrote Tiny Companion's third-person message as `Target shrinks.` where the
// suffix table keys on `Someone `. So the one pet-only member of the family was in NO table, could
// not be a candidate for its own landing, and the two halves of the rung could never meet. That is

// whole-log tripwire live in `src/main/data/spellCorrectionsSubjects.ts` under THE PET-BINDING HALF.
//
// WHERE THE BYTES COME FROM. A reporter's slice never becomes a fixture (AGENTS.md), so the window
// below is hand-built from shapes the OWNER's log prints — `<Name> shrinks.` 33 times (`Dranix`
