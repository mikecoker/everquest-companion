// Task #55 golden window: A MULTI-MOB PULL IS ONE ENCOUNTER.
//
// The report: the user pulled TWO mobs (Soldier of V`Zher + Baron Telyx V`Zher). When the
// Soldier died, the meter finalized the fight and opened a SECOND encounter holding the
// rest of the Baron fight. Details/WoW segmentation (and AGENTS.md law 7) says a pull ends
// when COMBAT ends — all engaged hostiles dead (+linger), a held CC expiring, or the
// fled-mob idle fallback — not when one add drops.
//
// ROOT CAUSE (verified against the engine): closure conflated two different clocks. An
// engaged instance was counted "gone" once LINGER_MS (5s) passed since the last ATTRIBUTED
// DAMAGE involving it — and only landed damage refreshed that clock. Misses, resists, mob
// cast phases and hostile-on-hostile heals refreshed nothing, so a second mob that was
// merely whiffing (or casting Stun/Root/Healing) looked dead within five seconds. The fix
// splits the axes: PRESENCE (any evidence the instance is still in the fight, with a 20s
// PRESENCE_GONE_MS leash for LIVE instances) vs TIMING (LINGER_MS, damage only — DPS and
// firstHit/lastHit stay damage-derived, AGENTS.md law 8).
//
// THE WINDOW — tests/fixtures/w24-multi-mob-no-split.log, raw log lines 991860..992222
// (Sun Aug 02 15:30:23 → 15:32:17), extracted verbatim by tests/extract-combat-fixtures.mjs
// (only player chat dropped). Hand-read; the load-bearing beats:
//   15:30:23  the PREVIOUS fight (a Teir`Dal rogue) is already underway…
//   15:30:27  …and is slain — then 12s of silence. The pull below provably opens its own
//             encounter, so this window must contain exactly TWO fights, not one blob.
//   15:30:39  the pull: Soldier of V`Zher lands on YOU; the Baron joins at 15:30:40.
//   15:31:01  "Baron Telyx V`Zher healed Soldier of V`Zher for 175 hit points by Healing."
//             — a hostile-on-hostile heal: presence evidence for BOTH mobs.
//   15:31:09  "You have slain Soldier of V`Zher!" — the reported split point.
//   15:31:11  the Baron fight continues unbroken (misses, a stun phase 15:31:20–24 where
//             YOU land nothing for 5s, two Root casts, two self-heals)…
//   15:32:00  "You have slain Baron Telyx V`Zher!" — the real end of the pull.
//
// HAND-COUNTED from the fixture's raw damage lines (regex over the text, no engine):
//   You → a Teir`Dal rogue      400  ( 7 hits)   [fight 1]
//   You → Soldier of V`Zher    1476  (33 hits)   [fight 2]
//   You → Baron Telyx V`Zher   2303  (54 hits)   [fight 2]  → pull total 3779
//   Soldier of V`Zher → You     323  (20 hits)
//   Baron Telyx V`Zher → You    455  (32 hits)
//   pull span: first damage 15:30:39 → last damage 15:32:00 = 81s.
//
// PRE-FIX this window produced THREE fights on a plain replay (the 15:31:20–25 stun gap
// alone split the Baron fight), and 146 fights once the snapshot poll ran a few seconds
// ahead of the ingested log lines — which is what the user actually saw, because the app
// polls snapshot(Date.now()) while the tailer delivers the log in multi-second batches.
