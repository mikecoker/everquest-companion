// GEAR TAB — the column picker, the configurable filter bar, and the width law that holds when a
// chosen set is wider than the pane (JOS-297). Pure model only: `gearColumns.ts` and `gearPrefs.ts`
// touch no React, no storage and no IPC, so they run under the node runner like `gearFilter` before
// them.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR, in one sentence per claim the ticket makes:
//
//   1. THE PICKER PERSISTS, AND EXPLICIT BEATS DERIVED. A stored choice wins outright, an absent
//      key falls back to the derived seed, and a stored EMPTY list is a choice rather than an
//      absence — the one distinction a naive `?? []` would erase.
//   2. EVERY EXPOSED KEY SORTS. The picker offers thirty-three keys and every one of them is a
//      working sort axis in BOTH directions, with an absent value LAST either way — which is the
//      property that makes "expose it on every header" safe rather than a promise.
//   3. THE WIDTHS FIT OR THE TABLE SCROLLS. Percentages while they can serve the set at a legible
//      floor, stated pixels plus a table minimum past that — and the pixel total is what the pane
//      scrolls sideways INSIDE itself. The e2e measures the scrolling; this measures the numbers.
//   4. A HIDDEN CONTROL IS NOT FILTERING. `inertFilters` is asserted field by field, including the
//      one whose inert value is NOT its default (era ships ON).
//
// The row fixtures here are SYNTHETIC, unlike `gearFilter.test.mts`'s: nothing below asserts a
// number the corpus states, only that the model treats every key in the vocabulary alike. Using
// two real items would have meant hand-writing thirty-three stats twice for no extra proof.
