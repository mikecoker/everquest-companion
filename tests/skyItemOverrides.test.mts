// ============================================================================
// JOS-186 — the hand-stated count, and the fourth count source it shares an idea with.
// ============================================================================
//
// The owner's 2026-08-14 ruling lifted this ticket's testing gate with two asks, and they are one
// idea at two scales: a count somebody vouched for at an INSTANT, plus the log trusted FORWARD from
// there. An override is that at item scale (`shared/itemOverrides.ts`); `rebaseline` is that at dump
// scale (`renderer/features/inventory/reconcile.ts`). So they are pinned in one file, because a
// change to the windowing rule has to break both or neither.
//
// WHAT THIS PINS, and why each claim is here rather than assumed:
//
//   1. THE PURE MODEL. One statement per key, later replaces earlier, a hand-edited store cannot
//      take the record down with it, and an epoch instant survives the sanitizer (the bug a shared
//      "whole non-negative, capped" helper would have introduced: a timestamp is not a bag count).
//   2. THE TWO REPORTS, AS TRACES. 01M0089H6NCBES55RTYHXDT05R destroyed a quest item and the Ready
//      tab nagged forever; 01KZZ51GNHKFNFC082CVGQQ9N8 asked for the export as a baseline with the
//      log counted only forward. Both run through the REAL `reconcile` and the REAL `readyQuests`.
//   3. THE FORWARD RULE, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. Loot after a baseline adds; loot before it is
//      discarded; a turn-in recorded after it subtracts; one recorded before it does not (the
//      double-subtraction reconcile.ts exists to stop).
//   4. REVERSIBILITY AS DEEP EQUALITY, not as prose. Clearing a statement returns the WHOLE
//      reconcile result — every row, every field, the row order, the `net` map — to what it was
//      before the statement was made. That is the ticket's "never contaminate the log-derived
//      record" written as an assertion.
//   5. ADDITIVITY. Passing the JOS-186 inputs empty is byte-identical to omitting them, which is
//      what makes the fourth source and the overrides an addition rather than a rewrite. (The
//      three-source arithmetic itself is pinned next door, tests/countSourceDefault.test.mts,
//      whose generated deep-equality space still passes untouched.)
//
// THE THIRD WINDOWED DISCOUNT IS PINNED NEXT DOOR: JOS-403 gave the DUMP witness the same treatment
// for turn-ins that JOS-401 gave it for destroys, and it lives in tests/skyTurnInAfterDump.test.mts
// because this file is at its measured `max-lines` ceiling. A change to the windowing rule has to
// break that file or this one.
//
// Only `computeQuestProgress`'s per-item clamp is mirrored, the division every Sky test here makes
// — the bare runner cannot load the React-heavy useProgress module.
//
// Run: `npm test`.
