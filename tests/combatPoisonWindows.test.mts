// Task #64 golden windows: ROGUE POISONS — coats, Strike procs, and time-to-slow.
//
// The user's ask: "add special combat support for rogue poisons … i want to see a line when
// rogue poisons land (specially slow) on the live combat scrolling graph. i want to measure
// the average time it takes to land slow if we have the correct poison applied. i want to be
// able to see the counts of spells (like the dispel variants and such)."
//
// WHAT THE LOG ACTUALLY SAYS (full sweep of eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt, 2026-08-03) — this
// is the evidence every assertion below is pinned to, and several of these facts contradict
// the obvious design:
//
//   1. COATS ARE FOUR SLOTS, NOT ONE — three combat venoms plus one utility poison (the owner,
//      2026-08-04; eqlwiki's Rogue page and the per-venom pages state the mechanism). Combat
//      venoms STACK across their three mutually-exclusive LINES; utility poisons all share one
//      slot and replace one another. The log proves the stacking half — the last coat line
//      before the fights in W36 is Neurotoxic (a UTILITY poison), yet Asp Venom Strike, Blood
//      Siphon Strike and Stunning Strike all proc during them, because the three COMBAT venoms
//      coated eighteen minutes earlier were still up. A single-slot model would have to call
//      those procs impossible. The last section of this file pins the slot model itself, the
//      line-replacement rule, the death boundary, and the rows the UI draws from all of it.
//   2. `<mob>'s limbs move slower!` IS the slow, and it IS a rogue poison proc: it is
//      Weakening Strike's cast-on-other message and exactly one spell in the whole DB carries
//      it. But FOUR poisons grant Weakening Strike (Weakening / Binding / Neurotoxic /
//      Paralytic), so a landing proves "a rogue slow", never a specific poison.
//   3. `<mob> feels a bit dispelled.` IS NOT A ROGUE PROC. It is the Cancel Magic family's
//      landing line — eleven classes plus NPCs print it (eqlwiki), and the log has 1,386 of
//      them against ZERO `blessings wither` lines, which is what the rogue's own dispel proc
//      (Banishing Strike) would print. W37 pins that: the dispel lane is counted, labeled with
//      every candidate, and never attributed.
//   4. The third-person coat line is printed WITHOUT A SPACE — `Skandercoats their blades in
//      poison.` — on both occurrences in the log. The matcher has to tolerate that.
//
// THE WINDOWS (all cut by tests/extract-combat-fixtures.mjs, which routes through the shared
// scrub; each is documented line-by-line there):
//   w35-poison-coats.log        01:05:08 → 01:23:00  every coat the user has ever applied
//   w36-poison-slow-timing.log  01:23:01 → 01:26:47  the fights those coats were on for
//   w37-dispel-variants.log     00:38:18 → 00:40:02  the Djarn kill: 4 dispels, ZERO poison
//
// W35 is replayed as a PRIME for W36 (the harness's established pattern): the coat that makes
// every fight in W36 slow-capable is applied seven minutes before the first swing, so a
// combat-only window could not establish it — and "was a slow even possible in this pull?" is
// the entire denominator of the measurement.
