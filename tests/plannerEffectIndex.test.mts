// EXALTATION PLANNER — the donor index, asserted against the REAL committed corpus
// (src/main/data/items.json, 11,247 records / 11,351 keys as of the 2026-08-03 scrape).
//
// This is the file that decides whether the Planner has anything to show: the pane is a browser
// over `buildPlannerDonors`, so "the Proc tab is empty" and "every Improved Healing donor
// vanished" are both failures of THIS function, and both are invisible in a hand-written fixture.
// So it runs the SHIPPED builder over the SHIPPED bytes. No Electron (effectIndex.ts is
// Electron-free on purpose — the mobSearch precedent), nothing skips.
//
// Assertions are FLOORS and IDENTITIES, never today's counts (AGENTS.md "frozen numbers rot" —
// the wiki gains item pages and a rescrape must be able to grow this file without turning the
// suite red). The floors sit under what the 2026-08-05 build measured:
//
//     click 803 · proc 446 · focus 119 · worn 100   = 1,468 donor rows
//     from 1,510 effect-bearing pages of 11,161 (190 alias keys skipped, 49 socketless
//     `Effect:` rows excluded, 3 duplicate-page rows collapsed, 40 pages excluded by V9)
//
// The V9 exclusion (`Summoned:` + the curated layer) is what re-based those from the 2026-08-04
// build's 1,508: it took 39 summoned rows and one GM-event row off the donor list permanently, so
// the floors below moved down with it rather than sitting a hair above the measurement. JOS-25
// then swept the corpus's GM-event prose properly and the exclusion measured 45 pages — the extra
// five are effect-bearing GM-event items, and the floors already sat under them. JOS-64 admitted
// the three GM-ONLY pages on the owner's ruling and it measured 47 (two of the three carry a click
// illusion); the floors still sit under that.
//
// The identities are the interesting half: one row per (key, effect, socket) with NO duplicates,
// and every slot token canonical. Both are properties the UI depends on and neither is a count.
