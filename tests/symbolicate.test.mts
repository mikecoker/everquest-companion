// SYMBOLICATION (JOS-100) — the VLQ decoder, pinned against a real build.
// ============================================================================
//
// `scripts/symbolicate.mts` implements Source Map v3's base64-VLQ decoding by hand rather than
// taking a dependency for it (that file's header says why). "We wrote it ourselves" is only an
// acceptable sentence if it is CHECKABLE, so this suite checks it two ways:
//
//   1. AGAINST HAND-WORKED VECTORS. The format's one real trap is that four of the five fields
//      are RELATIVE and only the generated column resets per line; getting that backwards
//      produces plausible-looking wrong answers rather than an error, so the deltas are
//      asserted explicitly.
//   2. AGAINST A MAP THIS REPO'S OWN BUILD PRODUCED — a ROUND TRIP: take a real generated
//      position out of `out/`, resolve it, and require the answer to name a file that exists in
//      this checkout. That is the assertion that would catch a decoder which is self-consistent
//      and wrong.
//
// THE SECOND HALF SKIPS WITHOUT A BUILD, and says so. `out/` is gitignored, so CI's `npm test`
// runs before `npm run build` in one job and after it in neither — a suite that failed there
// would be a suite nobody could keep green. The vectors above never skip.
