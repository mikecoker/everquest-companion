// One-off PET-CLAIM fixture extractor (JOS-47) — the unbound pet, the public lines it speaks,
// and the damage the meter throws away because nothing in the log says whose it is.
//
//   npm run fixtures:pet-claim -- "<path-to-eqlog>"
//
// (Run it under the tsx loader like its siblings — tests/fixture-scrub.mjs is a shim over the
// TypeScript src/shared/logScrub.ts. The npm script already does.)
//
// SCRUB: routed through the SHARED scrub, like every extractor. THIS FAMILY IS THE SECOND
// REASON THE SCRUB CHANGED (the group extractor's header records the first). The six pet-voiced
// SAY sentences carry the quoted-speech comma-quote, so until JOS-47 they were dropped from
// every committed fixture and every feedback slice — and they are the only public evidence that
// an entity is somebody's pet. They are an NPC's words and an NPC's name, so the carve-out costs
// no one their privacy; see src/shared/logScrub.ts for the enumeration that made it exact.
//
// …and it is the FOURTH reason too (JOS-52): `<Name> says, 'My leader is <You>.'` is the one
// pet-voiced line that names its OWNER, so it is the one that binds — and the one that carries a
// player's name inside the quote, so its carve-out is gated on `selfName` rather than on the
// speaker being an NPC. `keep()` below passes 'Primitive', which is what lets this extractor cut
// the owner's own answer while a stranger's pet naming a stranger still falls to the drop list.
//
// WHAT IS KEPT INSIDE A WINDOW: everything the scrub allows, verbatim and contiguous. The
// candidate detector reasons about SHARED TARGETS over time, so a window filtered down to "just
// the pet lines" would prove nothing at all.
//
// Line numbers below were located in eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt on 2026-08-06. The log only
// ever APPENDS, so historical line numbers stay valid as it grows; re-locate if it is truncated
// or rotated.

// and the app has never once been able to see it, because:

//   * the owner never ORDERS it, so it never sends the private `… Master.'` tell that is the

// It says `Sorry, Master... calming down.` twice, `Now regrouping, master.` once and
// `As you wish, oh great one.` once — all PUBLIC, all worthless as proof of ownership on their
// own, and until this extractor all four were scrubbed out of every fixture in the repo.
//
// Meanwhile it lands 105 hits for 1,966 points across four mobs, THREE of which the owner is
// hitting too (a noxious spider, a sonic bat, a fire giant warrior). Every one of those hits is
// dropped by classify()'s admission gate. This window is the reporter's bug reproduced in the
// owner's own log, which is the whole reason it is the fixture.

// P2 — THE WHOLE ARC OF A PET, IN ELEVEN MINUTES (Thu Aug 06 12:34–12:46, a Nagafen's Lair
// instance). Located by the owner, JOS-49.
//
// P1 is a pet that is NEVER bound; this is the other half of the story, and the half the
// currency gate exists for — the same window carries the UNBOUND period, the tell that ends it,
// the second pet that replaces the first, and that one's tell:
//
//   12:35:28  you zone into your own instance
//   12:35:43  `You begin casting Kintaz's Animation.` → Jaber
//   12:35:47→ Jaber fights the greater kobolds you are fighting. It is UNBOUND for seven and a
//             half minutes: nothing tells you it is yours, so every point of it is dropped.
//   12:43:12  `Jaber told you, 'Attacking a greater kobold Master.'` — the tell BINDS. The
//             question retires (it is an unbound-state offer).
//   12:44:45  a second Kintaz cast → Gonekn; the single-pet invariant retires Jaber.
//   12:44:51  Gonekn's own tell binds it, three seconds after its first swing.
//
// AND THE ANIMATION CASTS SPELLS, which is the fact this window exists to nail down. Jaber opens
// with `Jaber begins casting Wrath.`, lands 168-point magic hits by it, casts Stun, Daring and
// Symbol of Ryltan, and HEALS ITSELF (`Jaber healed himself for 104 hit points by Daring.`). A
// detector that treated casting or self-healing as player-shaped evidence would disqualify the
// one entity the feature exists for, silently, on the owner's own current pet.
//
// ONE LINE IN THIS SPAN WAS DELIBERATELY LOST TO THE SCRUB UNTIL JOS-52: `Jaber says, 'My leader
// is Primitive.'` (12:44:20), the `/pet who leader` answer. It is quoted speech outside the six
// pet-voiced sentences, so `scrubKeep` dropped it and the assertion below pinned its ABSENCE, so
// that the golden could not start depending on it before the carve-out existed. JOS-52 added the
// carve-out (gated on `selfName`, since this is the one pet-voiced line that names a PLAYER) and
// the bind, so the fixture was RE-CUT through the new scrub and the assertion is now a positive
// one. Re-cutting was measured before it was chosen: this line is the ONLY byte that moved in
// either fixture (p1 is byte-identical — the whole 1.4M-line log holds exactly one leader say),
// it arrives at 12:44:20 when Jaber has been bound by its own tell since 12:43:12, and
// `world.claim()` is idempotent — so every number in petClaimWindows.test.mts is unchanged, which
// that file's tests re-assert line by line.

// upgraded from a level 10 water elemental to a level 14 … relogging did not resolve"), in the

//   21:09:29  `You begin casting Haunting Corpse.` — the upgrade. The game says NOTHING about
//             the pet it replaces (JOS-54's whole premise) and the successor has a new name, so
//             the claim that would retire Vebann never arrives.
//   21:09:55  `You begin casting Intensify Death.` — a `targetType: Pet` spell. Only the player
//             prints this line, and the game will not let the spell land on anyone else's pet.
