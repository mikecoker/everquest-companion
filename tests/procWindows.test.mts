// THE PPM ENGINE + THE MINUTE-WINDOW LEDGER (docs/plans/proc-analytics.md §4.2–4.3, §5.1–5.2).
//
// THE ONE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE (AGENTS.md law 5): a rate below its sample floor is
// ABSENT, never 0. `1 proc in a 2-second pull` is not `30 ppm`, and `0.0 ppm` printed for a
// pull that was too short to measure is a lie the UI would repeat forever. So every floor test
// below asserts `undefined` explicitly — `assert.ok(!x)` would pass for 0 and prove nothing.
//
// The second half pins the ledger the Tier-B counterfactual is computed FROM: minute bucketing,
// the union of states observed in a window, the per-GROUP transition record, and the two
// eligibility gates. The comparison itself (medians, IQRs, verdicts, confounds) is a later
// wave; what is proved here is that the sample it will read is built correctly.
//
// Also pinned end-to-end: the active-time delta the ledger accrues is the ENGINE'S OWN number,
// not a re-derivation — the two can never drift, because there is only one computation.
