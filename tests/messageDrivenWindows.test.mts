// MESSAGE-DRIVEN GOLDEN-WINDOW TESTS (Task #34).
//
// Same hand-verified golden-window methodology as goldenWindows.test.mts (W1–W6), but for
// the message-driven buff model: the scraped spell DB (src/main/data/spells.json) is
// installed on the parser so it emits PRECISE buffApply / buffWearOff events from the exact
// chat messages the game prints, and the BuffsModule tracks the player's real self bar from
// them (plus self-heal-by-buff applies and Permanent Illusion).
//
// These use `replayBuffsWithDb` (DB installed) — separate from W1–W6's DB-free replay.
// node:test runs files sequentially and replayBuffs() clears the shared parser DB before
// each DB-free window, so the two suites never interfere.
//
// Run: `npm test`.
