// The promise under test: a store file written by ANY past build of this app loads cleanly
// in the build running today, forever. That is a claim about files nobody can produce on
// demand — the first-build store shape has not existed since commit 40b274b — so the
// fixtures here are AUTHORED snapshots of the real historical shapes, read straight out of
// `git log src/main/store.ts`:
//
//   store-v1-first-build.json   commit 89ee0da: one top-level `progress` blob, `liveLoot`
//                               inside it, no characters, no version.
//   store-v1-pre-framework.json every build from 41831cc to the one before this framework:
//                               `byCharacter`, the flat Task-#52 `overlay`, alerts, prefs,
//                               update bookkeeping — and still no version.
//   store-v99-future.json       a store from a build that does not exist yet, carrying a key
//                               this build has never heard of (the downgrade case).
//   store-v3-alerts.json        the shape every build shipped between class-combo corrections
//                               and voice alerts: alerts with no `audio`/`speech` at all, plus
//                               a hand-edited def carrying values no build ever wrote.
//   store-v4-presence.json      a fully-populated voice-era store (v0.2.0): characters, alerts
//                               WITH voice fields, a voice blob, per-kind overlay config with
//                               persisted bounds, an EQ-dir override and update bookkeeping —
//                               i.e. the file a real user upgrading into the cursor-ring build
//                               actually has on disk.
//
// No Electron, no log, no fixture *replay*: the runner is a pure function over plain objects
// and the file half takes a path, so this suite is as cheap and as unskippable as
// overlayLayout/updateCadence. The file-half tests use a throwaway temp dir.
