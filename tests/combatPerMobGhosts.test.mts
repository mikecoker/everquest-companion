// Task #58 golden window: THE PER-MOB PANEL SHOWS ONLY REAL INSTANCES.
//
// The report (integrator-verified against the real log + a user screenshot): the dashboard's
// "Damage by mob" panel showed FOUR rows for a two-mob fight against "a deadly black widow" —
// the two correct instance-labelled rows plus TWO 0-damage phantoms:
//
//   1. a bare "a deadly black widow" row. The panel groups the encounter's timeline instants
//      by their `target`, and the DAMAGE path writes the world-model INSTANCE label
//      (`world.label(world.resolve(...))` → "… (7)" / "… (8)", law 2 + the twin
//      disambiguation), while the MISS and RESIST paths wrote the RAW log name. Every whiff
//      at either twin therefore piled onto one phantom row that no instance owns.
//
//   2. an "on a deadly black widow" row. The frenzy miss family — "You try to frenzy ON X,
//      but miss!" — is the one prepositional verb in the "tr(y|ies) to <verb> <object>"
//      family (1,012 lines in the real log; verified as the ONLY one, full-log sweep). The
//      parser's object capture swallowed the preposition, so the miss target was literally
//      "on a deadly black widow". The LANDED form ("You frenzy on X for N points…") has
//      always parsed clean, which is why the ghost carried misses but never damage.
//
// THE FIX is symmetric with the damage path on both sides:
//   parser  — MISS_RE strips an optional leading "on " from the object capture.
//   engine  — routeMiss/routeResist run the defender through defenderLabel(), which
//             resolves to the world instance ONLY when that name is already ENGAGED in the
//             encounter. `engaged` membership comes exclusively from LANDED damage/heals, so
//             a whiff at a mob we have never damaged still spawns no instance and moves no
//             gen counter (AGENTS.md law 8: a miss/resist is damage-free AND side-effect-free).
//
// THE WINDOW — tests/fixtures/w25-per-mob-miss-ghosts.log, raw log lines 1006240..1007109
// (Sun Aug 02 16:50:57 → 16:53:23), extracted verbatim by tests/extract-combat-fixtures.mjs
// (only player chat dropped). Hand-read; the load-bearing beats:
//   16:50:57–16:52:09  a SIX-widow blob (gens 1–6) — a long chain of misses that must split
//                      across six instances instead of collapsing onto one bare row.
//   16:52:14–16:52:32  a vampire-bat fight. At 16:52:38 ONE whiff at a widow arrives while
//                      the bat encounter is still open (the widow's first DAMAGE is the very
//                      next line) — a mob that is NOT engaged here. It must keep its raw
//                      name and spawn nothing; if it spawned, the widows below would
//                      renumber to (8)/(9) and the user's labels would drift.
//   16:52:38–16:53:22  THE REPORTED FIGHT: exactly two widow instances, gens 7 and 8, and 56
//                      outgoing misses (the 57 in the wall-clock span minus the one at
//                      16:52:38 that lands before the fight's first damage, so it attaches to
//                      the still-open bat encounter — law 8: a miss never OPENS an encounter).
//
// REGRESSION TRIPWIRE: the pre-fix replay of this exact window produced fight totals
// 9052 / 2600 / 3045 and per-target damage totals identical to the ones asserted below —
// misses and resists carry no amount, so relabelling them cannot move a single point of
// damage. Miss COUNTS are conserved too: e1's 108 (102 bare + 6 "on") now distribute
// 18/24/16/19/8/23 across the six real instances.
