// JOS-84 — A SUGGESTED ALERT MUST FIRE ON THE LINE ITS SPELL PRINTS.
//
// THE REPORT. A v0.10.0 enchanter created the slow-landed alert FROM SUGGESTED and it never
// fired. They hand-edited the pattern (their slow is Shiftless Deeds) and it still never fired.
// They created the Incapacitate one and it never fired either.
//
// THE ROOT CAUSE, measured against their own log lines (feedback report
// 01KZEGGWTKYN7C8FMNPQ4Y181P — a reporter's slice, so it is quoted here and never committed):
// EQ prints ONE landing sentence for a whole spell family, and the parser says so. Their real
// lines resolve like this through src/main/log/parseCasts.ts + the committed spells.json:
//
//   `Coercer T`vala slows down.`   → buffApply { spell:'Forlorn Deeds',
//                                     candidates:[Forlorn Deeds, Languid Pace, Rejuvenation,
//                                                 Shiftless Deeds, Tepid Deeds] }
//   `Coercer T`vala looks frail.`  → buffApply { spell:'Disempower',
//                                     candidates:[Disempower, Incapacitate, Listless Power] }
//
// `buffApply.spell` is documented as a BEST-EFFORT first candidate (shared/logEvents.ts), and it
// is alphabetical — it is not, and cannot be, the spell the user cast. The `lands` suggestion
// template authored `where:{spell:'Shiftless Deeds'}`, which the alerts module compared to the
// literal string "Forlorn Deeds". It was never an anchor problem and never a self-cast /
// third-person problem: the trigger was pinned to a coin flip, and lost it every time.
//
// THE FIX under test: a `where.spell` matcher tests the event's WHOLE candidate list
// (main/modules/alerts.ts `spellCandidateNames`), and the fire reports the name that actually
// satisfied the matcher rather than the arbitrary pick (`matchedSpellName`) — so a spoken alert
// says "Shiftless Deeds", not "Forlorn Deeds".
//
// THE DEFS ARE NOT HAND-WRITTEN HERE. Every trigger below comes out of the REAL wizard path —
// buildSpellCatalog(loadSpellDb()) → suggestionsFor(entry, rank) — and goes into the REAL
// AlertsModule through the REAL parser. That path had never been executed by a test, because
// suggestions.ts imported a VALUE through the `@shared/*` alias and could not load under tsx at
// all; that is a large part of why this shipped. The alias import is now relative (repo law).
//
// Run: `npm test`.

// buff-expire included).
//
// TWO SEPARATE CAUSES, both fixed through the JOS-150 corrections overlay:
//   * `Sionachie's Dreams` wrote its landing as `Target's eyes glaze over.` where its three ladder
//     siblings write `Someone 's eyes glaze over.` — no `castOnOtherSuffix`, so the song was in no
//     table, `templates.lands` was false, and the sentence it really prints resolved to a
//     candidate list the song was not in. There was nothing to pin an alert to.
//   * The level-39 song is `Solon's Bravura` in the scrape and `Solon's Bewitching Bravura` in the
//     game. The name is the join key — `byKey`, the catalog `key`/`name`, and every `where.spell`
//     — so the landing alert and the break alert could not both be satisfied by one string.
//
// AND THE THIRD THING, which is why "buff-expire" was in the report: a mez on a mob emits no
// `buffExpired` and never could. Its break is a `cc {refresh:true}`, and until now the only alert
// that matched it was the family-wide "Mez / root broke" group. `breaks` is the per-spell one.
//
// THE LINES ARE REAL. The two `<mob>'s eyes glaze over.` landings and both `You begin singing`
// lines are the shapes slice 01KZAG2QAW885YJNRTDDND8BF2 carries verbatim; the owner's own log
