// parser, the REAL BuffsModule, the REAL BuffTimersModule and the REAL projection.
//
// Three field reports converge here and each one is a test below:
//   * a Mesmerization VII bar stuck at the base rank's 24 s while the real cast runs 42-47 s
//     (report 01KZJHXJVAA7FNRDW83CTAYSF8, with slice; owner's own live session measured 31-36 s
//     on the same line). The CC half had no learner at all — JOS-126's measured root cause.
//   * a friendly Resist Magic on an ally landing on the DEBUFF overlay (report
//     01KZKVA30Y4QW0DW22ZAK1XR6Z, folded in from JOS-136). Classification was falling back to a
//     tally of the entity dispositions a spell had faded on, so a beneficial spell on somebody
//     the model was not holding as a pet classified as a debuff.
//   * phantom Focus Death bars on pets, from a sentence six spells share and none of them cast.
