// ============================================================================
// replayChunkEdge.test.mts — the historical scan's READ-CHUNK BOUNDARY (JOS-373).
// ============================================================================
//
// THE HAZARD. A read chunk boundary falls at a fixed byte count (READ_CHUNK_BYTES) and lands
// wherever it lands — mid-line, and just as easily mid-CHARACTER. `consumeChunk` used to carry the
// trailing partial line as DECODED TEXT, so both halves of a straddling multi-byte sequence went
// through the decoder alone, each became U+FFFD, and the character was destroyed permanently — the
// two halves can never be rejoined once the decoder has replaced them. NOTHING DOWNSTREAM COULD
// NOTICE: the byte accounting (`endOffset`, the carry) stayed exactly right, and the only casualty
// was the NAME on the line. On the owner's 142 MB log that is ~142 chances per scan, aimed squarely
// at the lines carrying non-ASCII names.
//
// The live tail had the same bug against its own slice edge and fixed it first — see
// tests/tailerIo.test.mts, 'a multi-byte character straddling a slice edge survives'. These are that
// test's shape, aimed at the replay's boundary instead.
//
// TWO ARMS, BECAUSE NEITHER COVERS THE OTHER.
//   * The unit arm drives the real `consumeChunk` with hand-built buffers and splits the SAME bytes
//     at EVERY interior position. Putting a boundary at one exact byte inside a character is the
//     whole point, and a read stream can be ASKED for a chunk size but never made to promise one —
//     so the deterministic version of this test is the one that hands the splitter the two halves
//     itself. Sweeping every cut also makes the oracle exhaustive rather than a spot check.
//   * The end-to-end arm builds a real multi-megabyte log with characters placed at the REAL 1 MiB
//     boundaries and folds it through `scanLog`, because the seam that ships is the stream's.
//
// This lives beside replayChunking.test.mts rather than inside it: that file is the equivalence and
// live-handoff gate and is already at the repo's 400-line ceiling. It stayed GREEN throughout this
// change, which is the point — it never covered this, and a fix that its oracle cannot see is
// exactly the kind that needs a spec of its own.
