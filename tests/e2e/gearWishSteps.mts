/**
 * THE GEAR TAB'S WISH GESTURE (JOS-335) — a search row goes on the wish list, exactly as an
 * Exaltations donor row has since JOS-326 — AND COMES BACK OFF IT (JOS-343, owner ruling
 * 2026-08-13, revising JOS-335 the day after it shipped).
 *
 * WHAT THE REVISION REVISED, because a spec that quietly re-words its own claims is worse than one
 * that never made them. JOS-335 shipped a HEART that LIT and, lit, did nothing; this file asserted
 * exactly that, in the sentence "a second click leaves it lit rather than toggling the wish away".
 * The owner overruled both halves. The control is now the donor row's text control (one component,
 * `features/wishlist/WishToggle.tsx`, in its compact wording) and the second click REMOVES the
 * wish. So the old claim is not softened here — it is REPLACED by its opposite, and the removal is
 * proven where the add was: on the OTHER tab, in the route.
 *
 * A MODULE RATHER THAN MORE OF `gear.e2e.mts`, the `gearColumnSteps.mts` / `gearFilterSteps.mts`
 * precedent: everything this needs is already standing in the host spec, and that file sits at the
 * repo's 400-code-line factoring ceiling.
 *
 * WHAT NEEDS A REAL APP HERE, given `tests/wishlist.test.mts` owns every fold and
 * `tests/wishSearch.test.mts` owns `wishFromGear` without a DOM: the CHAIN, and nothing else. A
 * click on a windowed table row → `useWishlist.add`/`.remove` → the pure `addWish`/`removeWish` →
 * an IPC write → main's validator → electron-store → a SECOND VIEW, on a sibling tab, that
 * unmounted the first one and re-read the document from disk to draw its route. Four of those five
 * links are invisible to a unit test, and the fifth — that the REMOVE half is the same entry delete
 * the Wish list's own remove button calls — is only interesting once the document is real.
 *
 * THE WIDTH ASSERTION IS GONE (JOS-346), AND SAYING SO IS THE POINT. This file used to measure the
 * control's box against the Item column and fail if it took more than a third — the honest handling
 * of JOS-335's width argument, when the answer to that argument was a SHORTER pair of words on this
 * surface (`compact`: Wish / Remove). The owner overruled the short wording on 2026-08-13: the gear
 * row says "Add to wish list" / "Remove from wish list" exactly as the donor row does, and the width
 * cost is ACCEPTED. A ceiling that only the deleted wording could clear is not a test of the
 * shipped app, so it is deleted rather than loosened to a number the new label happens to fit.
 * What survives is the `note`: the run reports the wording and the boxes, so a reader can see the
 * cost the ruling accepted without a spec pretending to have a limit it does not have.
 *
 * THE REMOVAL IS PROVEN FROM THE OTHER TAB TOO (JOS-346). Step 5 removes from the gear row itself,
 * which only ever asked whether ONE mount can undo its own edit. The owner's bug was the other
 * direction — take the wish off on the Wish list tab, come back to Gear, and the control still read
 * ADDED — so step 4b does exactly that: the wish list's own per-row remove, then the trip back, then
 * the reading. It is the same claim the whole hook is about, made across two views instead of one.
 *
 * THE ROW IS CHOSEN OFF THE SCREEN, NEVER TYPED IN (AGENTS.md, "frozen numbers rot" — and a frozen
 * ITEM NAME rots the same way when the corpus is rescraped). Two properties are wanted and both are
 * read from the table itself:
 *
 *   * IN ERA, so the wish lands in the ROUTE rather than behind the wish list's own era filter.
 *     Guaranteed by WHERE this step runs — before `stepEra` turns the toggle off — so every row on
 *     screen is one the app's own `eraHides` admits, which is the same predicate the wish list uses.
 *   * NEITHER OWNED NOR LOOTED, so the wish is still WANTED. `wishFulfilled` sends a gear wish whose
 *     progress join reports a copy straight to the done strip, which is correct behaviour and the
 *     wrong half of the tab to be asserting a route entry in. An EMPTY Owned cell is the table's own
 *     statement that neither witness has seen the item, so the pick reads it and moves on.
 *
 * THE ADDED STATE IS ASSERTED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, which is the half a "does the add work" spec
 * would skip: it comes ON at the click, SURVIVES a trip to the other tab and back (so it is a fact
 * about the store rather than about React state), and goes OFF at the second click. A control that
 * could only ever light up would pass a build where the join is a one-way latch.
