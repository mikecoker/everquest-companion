// THE IN-WINDOW DROPS STEPS of the leveling spec (JOS-78), living next door because
// leveling.e2e.mts sits AT the repo max-lines budget and the rule here is to SPLIT, never ratchet
// (drill.mts set the precedent; combatSteps.mts and plannerSteps.mts followed it). The spec still
// owns the ORDER and the launch.
//
// WHAT THIS PROVES THAT NO UNIT TEST CAN. `tests/lootRates.test.mts` pins the arithmetic — the
// zone join, the half-open window, the active-time denominators, the ordering. What it cannot
// reach is the SEAM: that a loot line written into the tailed file travels the real path
// (chokidar → Tailer → parseEvent → LogBus → loot module → IPC → render) into a panel scoped by
// the very same `ScopedStats` the range panel reads, and that clicking a row there goes THROUGH
// the app's own `openLoot` opener — which is the only reason the drill's Back can say "Back to
// Leveling" and mean it (JOS-43: one navigation seam, never a per-view `cameFrom` prop).
//
// THE FIXTURE CARRIES NO LOOT AT ALL (e2e-leveling.log was cut for the charts), so the harness
// PLAYS it: `playLootDrops` appends four real dashed loot lines, three of one item and one of
// another, which is also what makes the ORDER assertable — a run where everything dropped once
// could not tell a sorted list from an unsorted one.
//
// WHY IT RUNS LAST among the chart steps: appending loot moves the progression module's activity
// stream (loot is one of the three columns `idleSpans` walks), so every "byte-identical" reading
// the timescale step takes must already be behind us.
