/**
 * The Gear tab's COLUMN PICKER, its configurable filter bar, and the width law that holds when a
 * chosen set is wider than the pane (JOS-297). A module rather than more of `gear.e2e.mts`, the
 * `gearSetSteps.mts` precedent: everything these steps need is already standing in the host spec,
 * and that file is at the repo's 400-code-line factoring ceiling.
 *
 * WHAT NEEDS A REAL APP HERE, given `tests/gearColumnPrefs.test.mts` owns the model without a DOM:
 *
 *   * THE WIDTH. `gearTableLayout` states pixels past ten columns and the table states a minimum —
 *     but whether that produces a scrollbar INSIDE the list box or a page that slides sideways is a
 *     fact about `tableLayout: fixed`, a flex row with `minWidth: 0`, and a real Chromium. No unit
 *     test can see it. This spec measures all three boxes in one breath: the list overflows, the
 *     document does not, the content area does not.
 *   * THE FIXED-HEIGHT CONTRACT. The windowing hook's every index assumes each row is exactly
 *     `ROW_HEIGHT`, and eighteen columns is precisely the situation in which a cell would wrap and
 *     desync it. So the rows are MEASURED, not trusted.
 *   * THE SORT ON A PICKED COLUMN, with the numbers read back at the plus-state the host spec left
 *     the global selector at — the picker must not have moved the arithmetic, only what is drawn.
 *   * PERSISTENCE ACROSS A PROCESS. `localStorage` is a real file under the temp `userData` dir, so
 *     the second launch is what proves an EXPLICIT choice beat the derivation rather than merely
 *     agreeing with it: it asserts a column the derivation would always draw (AC, a core column) is
 *     ABSENT, and one it would never draw (CHA) is present.
