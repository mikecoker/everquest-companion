/**
 * Headless Electron test for THE WINDOW REMEMBERING ITS SIZE (JOS-248).
 *
 * Report 01KZSYHKZDERT9P4YAFJN4N3QP (v0.22.0): can the app save its window size. The policy is
 * pure and pinned next door — tests/windowState.test.mts covers what is worth remembering (a
 * maximized window, a minimized one, a destroyed one, the debounce's coalescing) and
 * tests/displayFit.test.mts covers the geometry against monitor arrangements this machine does not
 * have. Three claims are left over, and every one of them is about a REAL WINDOW IN A REAL
 * PROCESS:
 *
 *   1. A fresh install comes up at TODAY'S DEFAULT SIZE, exactly. The requirement is a promise
 *      about the window a first-time user gets, and the only honest evidence is that window.
 *   2. A size and position chosen in one process is the size and position the NEXT process opens
 *      at. That is a claim about a file outliving the app that wrote it, so it is two launches
 *      over one userData dir — a reload would prove nothing.
 *   3. A rectangle on a monitor that no longer exists comes up ON SCREEN, and the store STILL
 *      REMEMBERS IT. Both halves matter: the clamp is what is SHOWN, never what is STORED, or a
 *      single launch with the cable out would silently destroy the layout the user chose (JOS-187's
 *      ruling for the overlays, which this window now shares).
 *
 * THE LOST MONITOR IS SUPPLIED HONESTLY, not simulated: a stored rectangle at x=9000, which is off
 * every display this machine has for the same reason the reporter's was off theirs. It is written
 * into the store BETWEEN launches, with no app running — electron-store rewrites the whole file
 * from its in-memory copy on any `set`, so an edit made underneath a live app would be a race with
 * every unrelated setting.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SPEC DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER: the maximize restore. `maximize()` is documented to
 * SHOW a window that is not being shown, and `EQ_E2E=1` exists precisely so that no window is ever
 * put over the user's game — so the restore lives inside that guard in windows.ts and this harness
 * must not reach around it. The two halves it would prove are pinned where they can be: that a
 * maximized window is remembered as its NORMAL bounds plus the flag (windowState.test.mts), and
 * that the flag is what `ready-to-show` acts on (source, one branch).
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- window-bounds`
