/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for the LEVELING tab
 * (docs/plans/leveling-analytics.md §8, "Final verification").
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN FILE: one spec per surface, all of them sharing `appHarness.mts` and running back
 * to back from `npm run test:e2e`. `EQ_E2E=1` (src/main/e2e.ts) shows no window, skips the
 * single-instance lock and points `userData` at a throwaway temp dir, so this runs invisibly
 * beside the user's game and dev app.
 *
 * WHY `userData` IS WIPED FIRST: several assertions here are about the state the tab comes up
 * in. Nothing about a selection or a timescale is persisted today (both are session-lifetime
 * component state, deliberately), but a fresh dir is what makes "before any interaction" mean
 * the same thing on every machine and after every earlier spec — which is what a per-launch
 * userData dir now guarantees for free.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS, against whatever the real log holds right now:
 *   1. the nav row mounts the view (or the no-logs empty state honestly explains why not);
 *   2. a chart is drawn, and the ZONE-BAND STRIP is mounted inside it with real bands;
 *   2b. (JOS-292) the level chart draws the FRACTIONAL CURVE - denser than the ding series it is
 *      anchored on, inside its own plot, with an uncertainty band over every stretch the log did
 *      not state, no vertex inside one, and a readout that says so rather than naming a bar
 *      position there. Step 2b lives in `curveSteps.mts`;
 *   3. the range-stats panel is mounted with the view and scoped to the TIMESCALE'S WINDOW
 *      (JOS-75 — it used to exist only while a drag did);
 *   4. a real pointer DRAG across the chart narrows that scope to the selection, and the panel
 *      re-derives WITH rows (hero cards + at least one per-zone row — `Σ zones[].spanMs ==
 *      durationMs` means a committed range always covers at least one zone row, even if it is
 *      the `unknown` one);
 *   5. a CLICK (under `DRAG_THRESHOLD_PX`) drops the selection and the panel FALLS BACK to the
 *      window, restoring exactly the numbers it had before the drag — the precedence contract;
 *   5b. the TIMESCALE control (JOS-71) offers only the windows this log can fill, and picking one
 *      replaces the whole time base: the strip re-cuts itself and stays inside its plot, the
 *      hover still resolves a cursor, a drag still commits a range and a click still dismisses it,
 *      and `All` restores the exact window it started on;
 *   5c. and (JOS-75) the DASHBOARD NUMBERS move with it — the range panel's stated stretch, its
 *      readouts and the AA pace panel all re-derive on a window change, dominate correctly
 *      (a window inside another can never count more), and come back BYTE-IDENTICAL at `All`;
 *   6. the "New at this level" panel is mounted with its stepper — and, once the combo module
 *      has resolved a loadout, draws real unlock rows for it (floors, never today's counts);
 *   6a. (JOS-391) and each spell row says what the spell is WORTH: compact damage/heal figures per
 *      mana, the `already yours (CLS N)` claim naming a level below the one on screen, the spell it
 *      replaces from the shipped line research, and the word `directional` said exactly ONCE on
 *      the panel rather than footnoted per row. Step 6a lives in `unlockRowSteps.mts`;
 *   6c. (JOS-392) the spell a row says it REPLACES is a hover target of its own, and the card that
 *      opens is that spell's - carrying the figures main read for it;
 *   6d. (JOS-392) and typing `27-28 cleric shaman` turns the panel into the matching spells, each
 *      row's chips stating the level each class gets it at, in any word order - then clearing the
 *      box gives the level view back. Steps 6c/6d live in `unlockRowSteps.mts` too;
 *   6e. (JOS-393) and a spell the wiki badges out of era is FOUND by that search and MARKED - the
 *      chip on the row, the same words on its card - while its in-era sibling one rung down the
 *      same ladder wears nothing;
 *   7. (JOS-289) THE WHOLE PAGE SCROLLS AND NO PANEL DOES: the window itself never scrolls, no
 *      panel on the tab shows an internal vertical scrollbar except the drops list whose row count
 *      earns one, and the deepest panel is reached by scrolling the PAGE. No renderer console
 *      errors either;
 *   7b. and at the narrowest window the app allows, the two columns STACK instead of sharing one
 *      height (JOS-151's collision, which JOS-289 removed the cause of): no panel draws over
 *      another, the stack is not a scroller, and both the timeslice control and the unlock stepper
 *      are still the thing at their own centre;
 *   7c. and a spell name in the per-level readout opens the full spell card. Steps 7/7b/7c live in
 *      `levelingLayoutSteps.mts`;
 *   8. (JOS-78) the IN-WINDOW DROPS panel is mounted with the tab, states its empty window rather
 *      than drawing a blank box, and fills from loot the harness plays into the tailed file —
 *      ordered by observed drops, each row stating a count and a rate over a STATED span that
 *      names its hour (JOS-288: elapsed by default, active behind the tab's basis toggle);
 *   9. and clicking a row opens that item's Loot drill-down (with its own per-zone drop-rate
 *      table) through the app's ONE navigation seam, so Back NAMES the Leveling tab and returns
 *      here (the JOS-43 law, on the app's newest cross-view link). Steps 8/9 live in
 *      `dropSteps.mts` — this spec is at the repo's max-lines budget.
 *
 * FRESH-MACHINE HONESTY. A machine with no EQ logs mounts no feature view at all, and a
 * character whose log carries fewer than two dings and fewer than two AA gains draws no chart —
 * `LevelingView` renders its stated empty state instead. Both are the CORRECT behaviour: the
 * spec detects them, asserts the honest EMPTY-state versions of the above (the view mounts, the
 * empty state says why, and no stats panel exists), `note()`s what it saw, and skips the
 * assertions that presuppose a drawn chart.
 *
 * Floors and identities only, never today's numbers (AGENTS.md: frozen numbers rot).
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e`.

/**
 * 5b. THE TIMESCALE (JOS-71) — the window is the user's to pick, and picking one must move the
 * WHOLE time base with it (world-model law 9: one `{t0,t1,bucketMs}` per chart).
 *
 * The three things this asserts that no unit test can:
 *   • the presets on screen are the ones this character's history can FILL — `All` alone on a
 *     short log, more rungs as the log gets longer, and never a rung that would draw empty time;
 *   • every interaction survives the swap. The drag-select range panel, the zone strip, the
 *     legend and the hover tooltip are re-exercised AT THE NARROW SCALE, because a window is
 *     exactly the shared state that lets them start disagreeing about what a pixel means;
 *   • the bands stay INSIDE their plot. `mergeZoneBands` clips to the domain, so a band drawn
 *     past the viewBox edge means the strip is still reading the old window while the curve
 *     reads the new one — the marker-swim shape, caught geometrically instead of by eye.
 *
 * The committed selection from the previous step is expected to be DROPPED by the switch: a range
 * the new window does not contain is not on the chart any more, so the panel falls back to the
 * window (it no longer unmounts — JOS-75).
 *
 * AND THE NUMBERS MOVE WITH IT (JOS-75, the ticket this step grew for). Everything the tab states
 * about a stretch of time is re-derived on the new window: the panel's stated stretch, its hero
 * readouts, its per-zone table and the AA pace tiles. Two things are asserted about that, and
 * both are identities rather than today's numbers — the narrow window's counts are DOMINATED by
 * the wide one's (a window inside another can never count more), and `All` comes back byte for
 * byte, which is the whole "nothing changes for the user who never touches the control" promise
 * stated in pixels instead of prose.
