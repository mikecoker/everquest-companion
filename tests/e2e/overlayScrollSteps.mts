// A PINNED OVERLAY STILL SCROLLS — and still passes clicks through (JOS-138).
//
// A 0.14.0 report: pin an overlay and its scrollbar stops working. That was true by construction.
// Pinned means `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true, {forward:true})`, and `forward` forwards mouse MOVES
// and nothing else — a wheel notch goes to whatever the OS hit test finds under the cursor, which
// for a click-through window is the game. So scrolling and click-through cannot both be true of
// the same pixel, and the owner's disposition (2026-08-09, "we should allow scroll") is bought by
// giving up the smallest patch of pixels that buys it: the SCROLL GRIP, a strip along the right
// edge of the pane where the scrollbar is already drawn (overlay/overlayScale.tsx).
//
// SO THIS STEP ASSERTS BOTH HALVES, and the second is the one that matters more:
//   1. the wheel moves the rows of a pinned meter, driven with the REAL pointer and a REAL wheel;
//   2. the rest of the pinned body takes no mouse at all — the pointer parked in the middle of the
//      same pane leaves the grip idle and reveals no chrome, which is the pin still being a pin.
//
// WHAT A HIDDEN WINDOW CAN AND CANNOT SAY. `EQ_E2E=1` shows no window, and no page can read its
// own `setIgnoreMouseEvents` state — so the window-level half is asserted through the two things
// that ARE observable from inside: the pane's own `data-scroll-grip` (what the renderer decided)
// and the header controls revealing (the round trip into main and back that only a taken capture
// produces — the same observable stepLockedSelector uses). Playwright's pointer and wheel are
// delivered by Chromium's input pipeline rather than by the OS, so they reach the page whether or
// not the window is composited; what they cannot prove is the OS hit test itself, and that is
// stated here rather than implied.
//
// Its own module because tests/e2e/overlay-sync.e2e.mts sits at the repo's max-lines budget:
// split, never ratchet (overlayScopeSteps.mts, drill.mts and combatPrefsSteps.mts precede it).
