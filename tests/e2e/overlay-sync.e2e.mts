/**
 * Headless Electron test for the two CROSS-WINDOW rulings of
 * docs/plans/combat-overlay-parity.md — P4/P5/P6 (fight selection is GLOBAL) and P3 (a LOCKED
 * overlay keeps its selector) — and, since JOS-40, for HOW THE OVERLAY WINDOWS ARE BUILT: the
 * opaque-overlay compatibility mode (an overlay reopened without transparency is still an
 * overlay, in both modes) and graphics safe mode (a third launch, because
 * `disableHardwareAcceleration` is decided before Electron is ready). Both live here because
 * both are claims about the window this spec already owns.
 *
 * SINCE JOS-121 it also owns the meter title bar's BUDGET. The scope word left that row for the
 * panel floor, and "the freed width went to the fight selector and to the drag surface" is a
 * geometry claim about a real window at a real width with a real mob name in its title — so
 * `stepTitleBarRoom` MEASURES it, reconstructing the old row in place to have something to
 * measure against.
 *
 * NOT HERE, AND DELIBERATELY: the overlays' TEXT SIZE (JOS-405) and their TRANSPARENCY (JOS-407),
 * which is the same arrangement one field over. This spec is the natural place to
 * look for either — it owns "two overlay windows agree about something" — and it has never asserted
 * anything about them, including under the retired fan-out. The cross-window claims (a control in
 * Preferences moves both meters, a control on one meter moves the other, and with the matching
 * switch on it stops doing that) live in tests/e2e/text-size.e2e.mts beside the CONTROLS, which is
 * where both are now set. This sentence is here so the next reader stops looking.
 *
 * WHAT ONLY THE REAL APP CAN SHOW. The pure halves are pinned elsewhere: the value model and the
 * one-seam wiring in tests/fightSelection.test.mts, the locked-selector mechanism in
 * tests/overlayLockedSelector.test.mts. What no unit test can claim is that the PIECES ARE WIRED
 * ACROSS PROCESSES — that a pick in the Combat tab crosses main and lands in a floating overlay's
 * own renderer, that the reverse works, that a zone-session id offered to the same door is
 * REFUSED, and that a locked overlay still renders a working selector while its bars do not.
 *
 * NO WINDOW IS EVER SHOWN. `EQ_E2E=1` is the whole test mode (src/main/e2e.ts): the main window
 * never shows and overlays skip `showInactive`, so the fight overlay here is created, loaded and
 * driven entirely off-screen while the user plays.
 *
 * IT DRIVES THE BRIDGES, NOT A CURSOR. A hidden, always-on-top window has no pointer, so the
 * selection half goes through the REAL `window.eq` / `window.eqOverlay` calls the selectors
 * themselves make — the same channels, the same validation in main. For the LOCKED half the
 * honest limit is stated in the assertions: this harness cannot make Windows deliver a forwarded
 * mouse event to a hidden window, so it asserts the two things it CAN see — that the selector is
 * rendered and interactive while locked, and that the header's hover sensor really does flip the
 * window's capture state (the lock/close controls reveal only when it has) — and it asserts the
 * click-through half NEGATIVELY, by checking the meter's bars offer no pointer at all.
 *
 * Assertions are identities/floors against whatever the live log contains right now — never
 * today's numbers (AGENTS.md: frozen numbers rot).
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e` (or `node --import tsx tests/e2e/overlay-sync.e2e.mts`).

 * `app.disableHardwareAcceleration()` is accepted ONLY before Electron's `ready` event, which is
 * why the composition root calls it from module scope. Get that placement wrong — move it into
 * `whenReady`, import it a line too late — and NOTHING fails: the call silently does nothing, the
 * app looks fine here, and the only person who finds out is the user who turned the switch on
 * because their screen was black. So this launch asserts the OUTCOME in Chromium's own terms:
 * with `EQ_DISABLE_GPU=1` in the environment, the process really is running with `--disable-gpu`,
 * and it still starts all the way to a hydrated window.
 *
 * The ENV door is what is tested rather than the stored switch, because they meet in one function
 * (src/main/graphics.ts) and the env half needs no second launch to write a setting first — and
 * because it is the door a user with an unusable window is told to use, and the one JOS-31 will
 * reuse for Wine.

 * window with "Resulting promise was garbage collected" — observed here, on a launch whose app was
 * otherwise perfectly healthy. The FACT under test is a launch-time constant that cannot change
 * between attempts, so asking again once the loop is free is asking the same question, not a
