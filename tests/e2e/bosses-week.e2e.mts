/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for THE BOSSES TAB'S WEEK VIEW (JOS-152).
 *
 * TWO ASKS FROM ONE RAID COORDINATOR, and this spec is the half neither can be proved without a
 * real app:
 *
 *   1. (01KZM0T1YNREY466752BQZVFBR) "the Bosses view forgets which tab you were on." The
 *      unit-testable part of the fix is a `useState` initialiser reading localStorage, and a test
 *      of THAT would pass while the feature stayed broken, because the bug was never in the read.
 *      It is the LIFECYCLE: `App`'s `ViewContent` mounts exactly one feature view at a time, so
 *      leaving the tab destroys `BossView` and everything it was holding. Every assertion below
 *      is therefore bracketed by a NAVIGATION, and the trip out asserts the toolbar is GONE first
 *      - an unmount that never happened would make the rest of this spec a tautology. The
 *      sky-filters spec makes the same argument at length for the same reason.
 *
 *   2. (01KZM0WD1DWQAXBB6EA0BZHE4A) the per-difficulty ladder. What is asserted here is that the
 *      rungs EXIST, that there are five of them per card in base-first order, and that they
 *      belong to the WEEK view and to no other - i.e. that the derivation reaches the screen.
 *
 * …and since JOS-171, that the ladder is where the card ENDS: the `Locked · <date>` / `open`
 * caption that used to sit under the rungs is gone, and a rung's hover is a bare date (a cleared
 * one) or no `title` attribute at all (an open one). That last half is the reason it is asserted
 * HERE rather than only in tests/bossLockouts.test.mts: an absent attribute and an empty one are
 * the same value in a unit assertion and are two different tooltips in a real browser.
 *
 * …and since JOS-237, that the toolbar's "Defeated only" switch answers the question THE VIEW IS
 * ASKING. It filtered on the all-time killed flag in both modes, so the week view hid nothing a
 * coordinator wanted hidden; the assertion is an equality between two readings of one screen (the
 * cards left standing == the cards drawing a green rung), which is why it can live here beside a
 * real clock. `stepDefeatedOnlyIsThisWeek` carries the argument.
 *
 * …and since JOS-239, that the OTHER grouping mounts and that its headers are honest — the
 * by-loadout switch had never been flipped by anything in this suite, so a whole view of the roster
 * had zero app-level coverage. `loadoutSectionSteps.mts` carries that argument and the step, out of
 * this file because it is at the 400-code-line ceiling.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SPEC DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ASSERT: which rungs are GREEN. "Cleared this week" is a
 * comparison against the real clock, and the committed e2e fixture's kills sit at fixed dates, so
 * any expected colour here would be true only until the next Tuesday 08:00 Pacific and would then
 * rot silently (AGENTS.md: frozen numbers rot). The colours are pinned where the clock is an
 * ARGUMENT rather than an ambient fact - tests/bossLockouts.test.mts replays the same fixtures at
 * three named instants either side of one reset. So the rung's `data-cleared` is read only to
 * prove every rung STATES an answer, never to say which.
 *
 * TWO LAUNCHES, ONE userData DIR. The tab round trip and the RESTART are different promises;
 * `makeUserData()` hands both launches the same dir, so launch 2 reads the localStorage launch 1
 * wrote through a real process exit.
 *
 * WHY IT NEVER TAKES THE SCREEN: `EQ_E2E=1` (src/main/e2e.ts) shows no window, skips the
 * single-instance lock, and points `userData` at a throwaway temp dir per launch.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- bosses-week` (or node --import tsx this file).

 * ways that both produced a FALSE FAILURE while this step was being written — a red saying the fix
 * does not work, with the fix correct in the tree:
 *
 *   • THE FOLD LANDS MID-STEP. The roster's cards exist before any kill does (a target draws a
 *     card whether or not you have killed it), so a reading taken while months of log are still
 *     folding sees 32 cards and 0 defeated, and one taken a second later sees 31 defeated.
 *     Comparing the first to the second is comparing two different worlds. Hence `waitHydrated`
 *     before the step, AND the tally — which comes from the same paint as the cards, so
 *     "the switch left exactly what the tally counts" is true of either world.
 *   • A LIVE RE-RENDER CAN REMOUNT THE VIEW (the `viewKey` remount the sky-filters spec argues
 *     with at length), and `defeatedOnly` is plain component state that a remount resets — it is
 *     deliberately not persisted. A remount between "the switch reads on" and "here are the cards"
 *     reports the UNFILTERED roster as the switch's answer. Hence the switch is read in the same
 *     evaluate, and a reading whose switch is not where we put it is re-taken rather than believed.
 *
 * An emptied roster is an ABSENCE, so it is settled by the reading STOPPING rather than by a count
 * arriving (wave E3): on a week with no lock at all the right answer is zero cards, and no
 * `settle` predicate would ever fire.

 * Three claims, and every one of them is clock-independent — which is why they can live here at
 * all (see the header: this spec never says WHICH rung is green, because the fixture's kills are
 * fixed dates and the reset is real time). "The ladder is the last thing in its box", "no card
 * writes Locked", and "a cleared rung carries a bare date while an open one carries no `title`
 * attribute" are all true on any Tuesday.
 *
 * A unit test can pin what `rungTitle` RETURNS; only the app can show that the value reaches the
 * DOM as an attribute at all — and that the open case reaches it as an ABSENCE. `''` and `null`
 * are the same string in a unit assertion and completely different tooltips in a browser.
