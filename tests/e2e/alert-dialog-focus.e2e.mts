/**
 * Headless Electron regression test for JOS-122 — THE ADD-ALERT DIALOG KEEPS YOUR WORK ACROSS A
 * FOCUS LOSS.
 *
 * THE DEFECT, as a 0.13.0 user reported it: Alerts → "Add from suggestion…" → "Create manually" →
 * type a name and change some fields → alt-tab away → alt-tab back → the dialog is blank again.
 * Everything typed is gone, in a core feature, with no way to get it back.
 *
 * THE CAUSE was one dependency. `AlertDialog`'s form hydrates from `initial` (or from blanks) in
 * an effect, and that effect listed `packs` — the installed sound packs — among its inputs. The
 * always-mounted `AlertPlayer` re-reads the shared alert store ON WINDOW FOCUS (player.tsx), the
 * alerts view reloads defs/prefs/PACKS behind it (useAlertsStore.ts), and a reload hands down a
 * BRAND-NEW ARRAY every time. So every return to the app was, to that effect, indistinguishable
 * from the dialog being opened afresh. The fix (alertForm.ts) is to hydrate on an OPENING rather
 * than on a prop identity.
 *
 * WHY IT IS AN E2E SPEC. Every link in that chain is a seam between real parts — a window event,
 * a module-level store, an IPC round trip, a React effect — and the bug lives in the JOIN, not in
 * any one of them. There is no renderer component-test rig in this repo, and a unit test that
 * called the hook directly would have to fake the very array identity that IS the bug. Only the
 * real app can show that coming back to it leaves the form alone.
 *
 * HOW THE FOCUS CYCLE IS DRIVEN, honestly: `window.dispatchEvent(new Event('focus'))`, which is
 * the exact listener a returning user trips (voice-alerts.e2e.mts already drives it this way and
 * says why — a hidden e2e window is never given real OS focus, by design).
 *
 * AND HOW IT IS PROVEN NOT TO BE A NO-OP. A focus event that did nothing would make this spec
 * pass for the wrong reason, so the cycle is GATED on its own consequence: an alert is written
 * straight through `window.eq.saveAlert` first, which the open view cannot see until something
 * makes it reload. The new row appearing in the list behind the dialog is proof that the whole
 * refresh ran — including the `setPacks` that used to wipe the form — before anything is
 * asserted. Under the old code the fields are already blank at that instant.
 *
 * IT ALSO CARRIES THE SUGGESTION PICKER'S LAYOUT CONTRACT (JOS-190, GitHub issue 22): this is the
 * spec that already opens that dialog, so the claim that its rows never print on top of themselves
 * runs here too. The measurement lives in `suggestRowSteps.mts`.
 *
 * …AND, FOR THE SAME REASON, THE APOSTROPHE FOLD (JOS-342): the query a user types has to reach a
 * row through the real box, the real tokenizer and the real IPC-delivered catalog. See
 * `APOSTROPHE_QUERIES` below for the report it comes from.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- alert-dialog-focus` (or
 * `node --import tsx tests/e2e/alert-dialog-focus.e2e.mts`).

 * test over a prejoined surface, and `snails healing` does not contain `snail's`.
 *
 * WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT ONLY A UNIT TEST. `tests/spellSearch.test.mts` proves the pure matcher and
 * the shipped catalog agree; what it cannot see is the box the user types into. The query crosses a
 * controlled MUI input, a memoized tokenizer, an IPC-delivered catalog and a sectioned, budgeted
