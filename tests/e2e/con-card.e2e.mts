/**
 * Headless Electron spec for JOS-383 — A CON PUTS A CARD ON THE SCREEN.
 *
 * WHAT ONLY THE REAL APP CAN SHOW. The pure halves are pinned elsewhere: the chips, the drop
 * ranking, the two refusals and the auto-hide knob in tests/conCard.test.mts, the queue's timing in
 * tests/toastQueue.test.mts, the estimator in tests/resistModel.test.mts, and the "no migration
 * needed" claim in tests/storeMigrationsConCard.test.mts. What no unit test can claim is that THE
 * PIECES ARE WIRED, and the wiring here spans a log file, a parser, three modules, a store and two
 * renderers:
 *
 *   1. A FRESH INSTALL ALREADY HAS THE WINDOW. This kind is the first strip to ship ON, and a
 *      default is a claim about a window that either exists or does not. Every launch gets a fresh
 *      userData dir, so this spec is always a first run — which makes it the only place that can
 *      prove the presence.
 *   2. A `/con` WRITTEN INTO THE LIVE LOG DRAWS THE CARD. The line goes down the whole real path
 *      (chokidar → Tailer → parseWorld → ConsiderModule → main/conCard.ts → the overlay window),
 *      and comes out as a named card with the level the line stated and its resist chips. Playing
 *      the line is the point: nothing in the fixture's history may draw a card, because a startup
 *      replay of a month of logs must not fire hundreds of them.
 *   3. THE CHIPS IT KEEPS, COLOUR AND WORD AND TAG — and NO ACRONYM anywhere on the card.
 *   4. THE CARD IS A LINK (JOS-390): clicking it anywhere but the × opens that creature's page in
 *      the APP — a claim that spans two renderers, main's `focusView` and the app's router — and
 *      the card stays up. Clicking the × instead closes it and navigates NOTHING. And unlocked,
 *      where a click is the user dragging the window, a click navigates nothing either.
 *   5. THE NEXT CON REPLACES IT. One card, never a stack.
 *   6. A PLAYER GETS NO CARD, from a con line that is the same shape on the same faction rung.
 *   7. THE × CLOSES IT, AND A RE-CON DOES NOT PUT IT BACK. The close is local and the suppression
 *      is main's; only a real round trip can show them agreeing.
 *   8. THE DEFAULT AUTO-HIDE LEAVES BY ITSELF, in about the three seconds the owner ruled
 *      (JOS-388 measured five here; JOS-390 is the ruling that made it three).
 *   9. THE PREFERENCE TURNS IT OFF, and the window goes with it.
 *
 * WHAT LEFT THIS SPEC IN JOS-390: every drop assertion. The card no longer carries a drop table —
 * the mob page does, and claim 4 is the click that opens it — so `stepDrops` went with the feature
 * rather than being rewritten. Its second job is the one thing that had to be replaced: it was the
 * spec's WAIT for main's second pass (the client spell table arriving), and that wait now lives in
 * the chip steps next door, on the creature that actually grows chips.
 *
 * THE HOLD IS PINNED FOR CLAIMS 2-7 AND ONLY FOR THEM. The shipped auto-hide is 3 s and this
 * gauntlet takes minutes, so the spec sets the card's own knob to "until I close it" before the
 * first `/con` (stepPinTheHold) — a real user's setting, written through Preferences' own door,
 * never an inflated default. Claim 8 puts the knob back and measures what an untouched install
 * actually does. See stepPinTheHold and stepDefaultHideLeaves for both halves of that argument.
 *
 * NO WINDOW IS EVER SHOWN. `EQ_E2E=1` is the whole test mode (src/main/e2e.ts): the main window
 * never shows and overlays skip `showInactive`, so the card here is created, loaded and driven
 * entirely off-screen. That is also why the DOM is asserted rather than the animation.
 *
 * THE SPELLS CARVE-OUT, exactly as tests/e2e/mob-resists.e2e.mts takes it: the resist estimate joins
 * the client's own `spells_us.txt`, which this repo may not carry, so the harness links the real
 * install's copy in (`{ spells: true }`). On a machine with no EverQuest the chips are still five
 * and still say a word each — they simply say "no data", which is the app's honest degraded branch
 * and a supported configuration in its own right.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- con-card`.

 * (tests/conCard.test.mts pins 3_000). What only this file can say is that the number is WIRED: it
 * survives the store, reaches the overlay window through the config echo, becomes the queue's hold

 * window transparent again, so the queue here is empty and the card this step watches is one it
 * drew itself — there is no earlier card whose disappearance could be mistaken for this one's.
 *
 * THE CLOCK STARTS AT THE FIRST PAINT NOW, and that changed with the feature. The card used to
 * arrive in two passes whose SECOND one re-`show`ed the same id with the drops on it, restarting
 * the hold (`cardQueue.ts` `fresh`) — so the honest t0 was "the drops landed". Since JOS-390 the
 * second pass is the spell table alone AND main only re-sends when the chips actually changed, so
 * by this point in the spec (the table was read cons ago) there is no second send at all and the
