/**
 * prefsFirstPaintSteps.mts — THE INSTRUMENT THAT CAN SEE A FLICKER (JOS-340).
 *
 * Every other assertion this repo makes about a control reads it AFTER it settles, because
 * settling is what makes a claim deterministic (`settle`, `settleStable` — the wait-for-the-
 * condition law). That is exactly the wrong instrument here. The defect under test is a control
 * that ends up RIGHT and was WRONG on its first painted frame, so a settled read is guaranteed to
 * report green on the broken build and on the fixed one alike. The settle is what hides the flash.
 *
 * SO THIS RECORDS INSTEAD OF READING. A `MutationObserver` is installed through
 * `page.addInitScript` — which Playwright runs before ANY page script, on every navigation
 * including a reload, so there is no window in which the app could paint before the recorder
 * exists. Every DOM change samples the watched controls, and each control keeps the ORDERED LIST
 * of distinct values it has shown. A control that was always right reports one entry. A control
 * that flashed reports two, and the test prints the sequence, which names the bug: `off -> on` is
 * a stored ON that mounted on a `false` default.
 *
 * WHY A MUTATION OBSERVER AND NOT `requestAnimationFrame`. rAF can be throttled to nothing in a
 * never-composited window (AGENTS.md, wave E3 — the measured trap `nextFrames` exists for), and
 * this whole suite runs windows that are never shown. A MutationObserver callback is a microtask
 * checkpoint after the DOM changes, so it fires whether or not a frame is ever produced, and it
 * fires on the INSERTION of the control as well as on its later class changes. That covers both
 * halves: the value a control is born with, and every value it takes afterwards.
 *
 * WHAT IT SAMPLES, per kind:
 *   'switch' — the MUI `Switch`'s own `<input type=checkbox>`, read as the `checked` PROPERTY.
 *              React has already set it before the node is inserted, so the insertion sample is
 *              the first painted state. (The observer is armed on `class` too, because MUI
 *              expresses a later flip as a `Mui-checked` class swap, which a property write alone
 *              would not announce.)
 *   'toggle' — a `ToggleButtonGroup`'s lit member, by the `data-testid` of whatever carries
 *              `aria-pressed="true"`. Nothing in Preferences uses one at the moment; the reader
 *              stays because it is the shape of control this kind of watching is FOR and the next
 *              one to arrive should not have to reinvent it.
 *   'text'   — what a readout SAYS, trimmed. The Appearance section's steppers print their value
 *              (JOS-408 replaced the five-stop ladder with an A− / A+), and a percentage flashes
 *              exactly the same way a switch does — the law is not about checkboxes.

/**
 * THE CONTROLS THIS SPEC WATCHES, and why these three.
 *
 * The two Overlays switches are the ticket's own claim and they point OPPOSITE WAYS, which is the
 * only way to prove the fix is not just "default to true and hope": `hideWhenNotRunning` ships
 * `true` and is stored `false` here, `hideWhenUnfocused` ships `false` and is stored `true`. A
 * build that flashes would flash them in opposite directions, and a fix that only cured one
 * direction would leave exactly one of them red.
 *
 * The Appearance section's in-app text size is the non-boolean, because "a control never paints a
 * value it does not know" is not a rule about checkboxes. It is watched as TEXT since JOS-408: the
 * five-stop ladder became an A− / A+ with a percentage between them, so the value the control is
 * born with is a string rather than a lit button.
 *
 * And the OVERLAYS switch is the fourth: it is the one control in the pane whose stored value can
 * be decided by a MIGRATION rather than by a click (JOS-407's least-harm rule, reconciled onto both
 * flags by JOS-408), and it also decides which SHAPE the card below it has — so a flash there is
 * not one wrong control but a whole card mounting the wrong way round.
 *
 * The Alert banner switch is the REGRESSION (owner, hands-on, 2026-08-16): a card written after
 * JOS-340 that mounted on its default anyway, on the argument that the banner ships OFF so OFF is
 * the honest first guess. Stored ON here, so a card that guesses is caught in the same section as
 * the two originals — and its switch is not a plain preference but an overlay's OPEN-STATE, which
 * is the one shape of control the first three do not cover.

 * created by this same text, already knowing what to look for, so a reload cannot land in a gap
