/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for the MAPS tab (docs/plans/map-viewer.md §12).
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN FILE: same reason the Overview spec is its own — one spec per surface, all three
 * sharing `appHarness.mts` and running back to back from `npm run test:e2e`. `EQ_E2E=1`
 * (src/main/e2e.ts) shows no window, skips the single-instance lock and points `userData` at a
 * throwaway temp dir, so this runs invisibly beside the user's game and dev app.
 *
 * WHY `userData` IS WIPED FIRST: the headline assertion is AUTO-OPEN — the log says which zone
 * you are in and the viewer opens that zone's map without being asked. The viewer also remembers
 * the last zone in `localStorage['eq.maps.zone']`, which lives inside `userData`; a stale one
 * would open a map the log never asked for and make the assertion vacuous. Every launch now gets
 * a userData dir of its own, so "wiped first" is simply what a launch is.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS, against whatever the real machine holds right now: the nav row mounts the
 * view; the canvas has non-zero size and a devicePixelRatio-scaled backing store (the difference
 * between a crisp map and a blurry one); when the log has stated a zone AND the hand-authored
 * table resolves it, the header states that zone and names a source pack per layer; the SIDEBAR
 * is on screen WITHOUT BEING ASKED FOR (it is the default experience, and this run starts from a
 * wiped `userData`, so nothing remembered can be producing it); it lists the wiki's mobs and the
 * map's own labels and filters both from one box; it is a BOUNDED scroll box (the Task-#56 law,
 * measured); clicking a row centres the viewport on it (asserted through the pin's screen
 * position — a real transform change) and rings it; closing it gives the width back to the map
 * and leaves a way back in; and one query reaches the corpus — a label prefix taken from the map
 * on screen lists matches in OTHER zones, and clicking one loads that zone and flashes the
 * transient marker. THE SAME BOX ALSO REACHES THE WIKI'S BESTIARY IN EVERY OTHER ZONE (JOS-135):
 * a High Keep NPC no map pack labels anywhere is found from wherever you happen to be standing,
 * the row names the zone it will take you to, and clicking it opens that zone's map and marks the
 * spot his page stated. And there are no renderer console errors.
 *
 * FRESH-MACHINE HONESTY, twice over. A machine with no EQ install has no logs (so the app shows
 * its no-logs empty state and no feature view mounts at all) and no `maps\` directory (so the
 * viewer shows its quiet picker). Both are the CORRECT behaviour, not failures: the spec detects
 * them, `note()`s what it saw, and skips the assertions that presuppose data. The same is true
 * of a zone the table does not map — the EQL Tutorial is the known case — where the picker, not
 * a guessed map, is the pass.
 *
 * Floors and identities only, never today's numbers (AGENTS.md: frozen numbers rot).
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e` (this spec runs last).

 * does cannot tell you where the row was a frame earlier.

 * onto a second line as eight drawing controls appeared, 32 px taken off the bottom by the credits
