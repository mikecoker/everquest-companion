// ============================================================================
// WHAT RIDES A SESSION REPORT, READ OFF THE RING — steps for tests/e2e/telemetry.e2e.mts.
// ============================================================================
//
// A MODULE RATHER THAN MORE OF THAT SPEC, for `errorReportSteps.mts`'s reason: JOS-367's steps
// put the spec past the repo's 400-code-line ceiling, and the answer here is a split.
//
// THE CUT IS A REAL SEAM, and it is why the startup reading (JOS-57) moved in here beside them
// rather than being left behind: both are measurements that RIDE `sessionHeartbeat` / `sessionEnd`
// rather than arriving as events of their own, both are therefore invisible from inside a running
// launch, and both are asserted the same single way — by reading `<userData>/telemetry.json` after
// the process that wrote it has exited. One subject, one file. The spec keeps its own (consent,
// the bar, the switch, the buffer).
//
// WHY THESE ASSERTIONS CANNOT BE UNIT TESTS. Every hop of this feature is a seam:
//
//     markStartupPhase('replayDone')  →  two 250 ms timers, one of them in a WORKER THREAD
//         →  the worker's messages crossing back to main  →  the drain onto sessionEnd
//         →  <userData>/telemetry.json
//
// `tests/liveStalls.test.mts` drives every fold, bucket and the coincidence matcher directly and
// proves their arithmetic; only a running app proves that a fourth rollup entry really emitted a
// loadable `perfProbeWorker.js`, that a thread started inside a packaged main bundle, and that
// the chain closes. That is the exact failure JOS-364 was written to correct one event over — a
// schema, a rollup and a panel all fine while nothing ever emits, which reads as "the fleet has
// no stalls".
//
// READ AFTER THE PROCESS EXITS, because the drain rides `sessionEnd`: a heartbeat is ten minutes
// away and this suite caps a spec at five, and `sessionEnd` is the arm most real sessions use
// anyway (most sessions end before the ten-minute mark).

/**
 * THE STARTUP READING ACTUALLY FIRED (JOS-57) — read off the ring FILE, with the app that wrote
 * it gone. It cannot be observed from inside a running launch: the reading is produced when the
 * replay finishes and is carried by the next session report, which is a heartbeat ten minutes
 * later (JOS-269; it was five, and a suite that caps a spec at 5 min was never going to see it
 * either way) or the `sessionEnd` written on the way out — and it is the `sessionEnd` arm this
 * asserts, which is the arm that got MORE common, not less. So this is the only place the chain —
 * `replayDone` → perf.ts → the collector's pending slot → `sessionEnd` → the ring on disk — is
 * visible at once, and it is exactly the failure JOS-39 was about: a schema and a panel that are
 * both fine while nothing ever emits, which reads as "the fleet has no slow launches".
 *
 * The numbers are asserted as SHAPE, not as values: this launch really did replay the staged
 * fixture, so a millisecond figure is a property of the machine running the suite (frozen numbers
 * rot). What must be true on any machine is that the reading exists, carries all six fields, and
 * that the size is a BUCKET INDEX rather than a byte count.
