// THE ERROR REPORT, END TO END (JOS-100) — steps for tests/e2e/telemetry.e2e.mts.
// ============================================================================
//
// A MODULE RATHER THAN MORE OF THAT SPEC, because adding these steps put it past the repo's
// 400-code-line ceiling and the answer to that here is a split, not a widened threshold. The cut
// is a real seam: everything in this file is about the one event kind whose journey nothing else
// in that spec touches, and the spec keeps its own subject (consent, the bar, the switch, the
// buffer).
//
// WHY THESE ASSERTIONS CANNOT BE UNIT TESTS. Every hop of this feature is a seam:
//
//     window.onerror  →  error:report IPC  →  logError's funnel in main  →  the redactor
//         →  the breadcrumb ring (fed from LogBus.emit by the app parsing the staged fixture)
//         →  the drain onto sessionEnd  →  <userData>/telemetry.json
//
// `tests/errorReportProducer.test.mts` drives the leaves directly and proves their arithmetic;
// only the running app proves they are WIRED to each other. And the read happens AFTER the
// process exits, because the drain rides `sessionEnd` — which is written only when the app quits
// the way a user quits (the `byWindow` launch; see `closeWindows` in the spec).
