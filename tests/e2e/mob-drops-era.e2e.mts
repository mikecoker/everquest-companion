/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for THE ERA FOLD ON MOB LOOT (JOS-377).
 *
 * THE BUG, in the owner's words: the Cazic Thule mob page lists Fear-revamp loot that is not in
 * the game. The wiki's own mob page transcludes `{{:Item}}` per row and each row draws its OUT OF
 * ERA pill from the ITEM page; our mob-loot surfaces rendered the catalog's `dropsWiki` straight
 * through and never consulted the era layer, so seven items - Bile Etched Obsidian Choker, Brain
 * of Cazic Thule, Cloak of the Fearsome, Eye of Cazic Thule, Halo of the Enlightened, Pauldrons of
 * Ferocity, Robe of Inspiration - were offered as loot you could go and get.
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN FILE. There was no mobs spec: the mob page is reached inside `deep-link-back` (whose
 * subject is the NAVIGATION SEAM and which is at its own factoring ceiling) and nowhere else. This
 * one's subject is a DATA LAW rendered on two surfaces, so it drives both in one launch - the
 * Overview's current-mob card and the Mobs tab's creature page - which is also what keeps the
 * suite from paying for a second Electron.
 *
 * WHY IT CAN STATE EXACT NUMBERS where a live-log spec must state floors: nothing here is read off
 * the player's log. The drop table is the COMMITTED catalog (`data/eqlegends/mobs.json`) and the
 * era evidence is the COMMITTED item corpus (`main/data/items.json`), so 18 = 11 + 7 is a fact
 * about bytes in the repo. `tests/mobDropEra.test.mts` pins the same split without a browser; this
 * spec is about what a READER sees, which is the half a unit test cannot reach.
 *
 * THE ONE THING IT READS FROM A LOG is the current-mob card's SUBJECT: the card follows
 * `currentTarget`, so the spec scripts a pull at Cazic Thule through the append driver, the same
 * path a real `You crush …` takes.
 *
 * WHY IT NEVER TAKES THE SCREEN: `EQ_E2E=1` (src/main/e2e.ts) shows no window, skips the
 * single-instance lock, and points `userData` at a throwaway temp dir minted per launch.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- mob-drops-era`.
