// THE LEVELING TAB'S LAYOUT CONTRACT — the PAGE scrolls and the panels do not, and no two panels
// draw over each other (JOS-289, which inverted the claim JOS-151 wrote here; GitHub issue 14).
//
// LIVING NEXT DOOR because leveling.e2e.mts sits AT the repo max-lines budget and the rule here is
// to SPLIT, never ratchet — sliceSteps.mts states the precedent and dropSteps.mts, combatSteps.mts
// and plannerSteps.mts set it. Both halves of "what this tab does with the height it is given"
// live together: the scroll claim and the narrow-window collision claim are only meaningful about
// each other.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE USED TO ASSERT, AND WHY IT NO LONGER DOES. Until JOS-289 the headline check was
// `the Leveling tab never scrolls the page (its panels scroll inside themselves)` — the standing
// app law, honestly measured. The OWNER OVERTURNED THE LAW FOR THIS TAB (directive 2026-08-13,
// verbatim: *the entire pane should scroll*). The panels-scroll-inside-themselves half was the
// defect, not the design: the per-level SPELL READOUT was four and a half rows of a twelve-row
// list read through a 120px slot, the zone legend showed two wrapped lines of however many zones
// you had visited, the AA ledger showed seven of fifty abilities, and the whole charts column sat
// behind a scroller of its own. So the assertion is INVERTED rather than deleted: the app content
// area is the ONE scroller, the view owns none, and the deepest panel is reachable by scrolling
// the page. `over.doc === 0` survives untouched — the WINDOW must still never scroll; the shell is
// `height: 100vh; overflow: hidden` and a document scrollbar would mean the chrome had moved.
//
// AND WHERE "New at this level" LIVES NOW (JOS-300, owner directive 2026-08-13). JOS-289 left it
// full width under both columns, which put a browsable reference panel at the page's own bottom
// and left an enormous hole beside it: the charts column ends well short of the
// ledger/drops/feed column. The panel moved into the BOTTOM OF THE LEFT COLUMN to fill that hole,
// which retires a claim this file used to make. "Deepest" no longer means "last": whichever
// column is taller owns the page's bottom, and on a log with a long AA ledger that is the RIGHT
// one, so scrolling the content area to `scrollHeight` can legitimately leave the panel ABOVE the
// fold. What survives — and what the owner's sentence was ever about — is that the panel is
// reached by scrolling the PAGE rather than by finding a box to scroll inside it. That is what
// `stepPageScroll` measures now: a scroll request routed through the content area (the only
// scroller between this panel and the window) brings it fully into view, and the content area's
// own scrollTop MOVED to do it. The page-really-grows half is still measured, as its own claim
// about the page rather than about the panel.
//
// WHY THE NARROW CHECKS ARE SHAPED THIS WAY. "Do two panels overlap" is only an honest question
// about boxes the user can SEE, and a page-tall view has most of itself outside the viewport at
// any moment — a raw `getBoundingClientRect()` cheerfully reports a panel two screens down sitting
// on top of one in frame. So every box is intersected with EVERY clipping ancestor first (`hoverAt`
// in appHarness.mts had to learn the same lesson), and a band scrolled out of frame has zero area
// and cannot collide with anything.
//
// WHAT THE ORIGINAL DEFECT WAS, measured at the reporter's 1073x937: below MUI's `lg` the tab's
// two columns became two rows and kept their side-by-side 2:1 split of a FIXED height. The second
// band was handed 198px for three intrinsically tall papers, the AA ledger squeezed to 89px, the
// progress feed to 34px, and both spilled and drew over "New at this level" (23px and 34px of real
// overlap). There is no fixed height to split any more, which is a stronger fix than the stacking
// one — but the collision check stays, because "stronger fix" is a claim and this is a measurement.
//
// AND WHY 900: that is the main window's own `minWidth` (src/main/windows.ts), so it is the
// narrowest the user can actually make it and the worst case for a height split. The reporter's
// 1073 is the same branch of the same breakpoint — one width proves the branch.
