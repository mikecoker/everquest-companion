/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for VOICE ALERTS (docs/plans/voice-alerts.md, wave 2).
 *
 * THERE IS NO MASTER SWITCH ANY MORE, and this spec is where that is proven end to end. It used
 * to drive one: turn on "Speak alerts out loud", check it reached main's store, and only then
 * exercise the rest — which is exactly why the row's ▶ bug survived (owner, 2026-08-04). A user
 * who never found that toggle set a row's output to "Voice (spoken)", pressed play, and heard the
 * old pack sound, because the retired switch degraded every spoken alert to its sound while it was
 * off. The test agreed with the app and both were wrong about the product. So the first thing
 * asserted here now is the ABSENCE of that control, in the panel AND in the stored prefs.
 *
 * WHY IT IS AN E2E SPEC AND NOT A UNIT TEST: every claim this wave makes is a SEAM, and the
 * pure halves are already pinned elsewhere (tests/voiceAlerts.test.mts for the plan/throttle/
 * voice-matching decisions, tests/alertPreview.test.mts for preview == firing,
 * tests/speechText.test.mts for the text). What only the real app can show is that the pieces are
 * actually WIRED:
 *   - the Preferences → Voice section mounts as pure configuration, with no enable switch in it
 *     and none in main's stored blob (electron-store is main-owned; the only honest proof is the
 *     round trip);
 *   - the editor's live preview resolves through `speechTextFor` with NO firing at all — the
 *     whole reason that function takes an optional firing;
 *   - a def saved with `audio:'speech'` makes the firing path reach the ENGINE SEAM, which
 *     crosses the dialog, the store, main, the player and lib/speech;
 *   - a tier with nothing to speak with SAYS SO on the alert row itself, rather than leaving the
 *     user to discover it by pressing play.
 *
 * IT ASSERTS THE SEAM, NEVER THE AUDIO. `lib/speech.ts` records every utterance on
 * `window.__eqSpeech` with an `uttered` flag and returns BEFORE touching any engine whenever
 * `window.eq.isE2E` is true. So this spec reads that ring — which gives it two independent
 * claims from one action: the seam was invoked (the record exists, with the right text) AND
 * the e2e channel stayed SILENT (`uttered === false`).
 *
 * THE SILENCE IS THE POINT, not a convenience. `npm run test:e2e` runs beside the user's live
 * game with no window ever shown (AGENTS.md); a headless test that spoke out loud would be the
 * most intrusive thing in this repo. That is asserted here explicitly, so it cannot regress
 * quietly.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e` (or `node --import tsx tests/e2e/voice-alerts.e2e.mts`).
