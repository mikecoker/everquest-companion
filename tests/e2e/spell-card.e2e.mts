/**
 * Headless Electron spec for JOS-293 — HOVER A SPELL'S NAME AND THE APP TELLS YOU WHETHER IT IS
 * WORTH MEMORIZING.
 *
 * WHAT THE OWNER ASKED FOR: the spell tooltip was "quite bad" — a name and nothing behind it —
 * while `spells.json` has held the whole record since the JOS-251 scrape. The card is the fix, and
 * this spec is the claim that it reaches a real surface, over the real IPC, with the real committed
 * DB behind it: the suggested-alerts wizard, where a user is choosing which spells to care about.
 *
 * WHY IT IS AN E2E SPEC AND NOT A UNIT TEST. `tests/spellDetailFacts.test.mts` owns the fact
 * SELECTION facet by facet, over the same committed DB, and it can see none of this:
 *
 *   1. A REAL POINTER on a real row OPENS the card. The anchor, MUI's popper, the fetch-on-open
 *      body and the `spells:detail` handler are four separate parts, and only a running app has
 *      all four. A card that never opens passes every unit test ever written for it.
 *   2. THE NUMBERS ON SCREEN ARE THE COMMITTED DB'S. The values below are quoted out of
 *      `src/main/data/spells.json` — `Celestial Remedy`: 75 mana, 4.00s cast, `24 Sec`, one
 *      effect line — so this is an exact reading, not a "something rendered" smoke test.
 *   3. AN ABSENT FIELD IS ABSENT ON SCREEN (world-model law 1). The same card, drawn for two
 *      spells, must show the instrument row for the bard song whose page states one and NO row at
 *      all for the cleric heal whose page does not. Proving that needs two draws of one component,
 *      which is a thing only the running list can give.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- spell-card`.
