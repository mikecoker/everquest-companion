/**
 * THE GEAR TAB'S COMPARISON PAIR (JOS-338, rewritten by JOS-344) — hover a search row and the app
 * draws the item you are pointing at and, beside it, what you are wearing in the slots it would go
 * in, WHERE A HUMAN CAN SEE THEM.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE LESSON THIS FILE EXISTS TO CARRY: DOM PRESENCE IS NOT VISIBILITY
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The first version of this module asserted that the card was in the DOM and what it said, and
 * every one of those assertions was green while the owner's screen showed NOTHING. Measured in a
 * headless run at the default window size: viewport 1268 wide, the anchored full-width `<tr>`
 * ending at x=1251, and the card drawn from x=1265 to x=1520 — three pixels of it inside the
 * glass. A card can be present, correct, readable by `textContent` and completely invisible.
 *
 * So the containment check below is not a nicety, it is the point: at the DEFAULT window size and
 * again at a NARROW one, both cards' boxes must lie inside the viewport. `checkPairOnScreen` is
 * exported because the Exaltations browser's donor rows mount the same pair (JOS-344 part 3) and
 * one law wants one instrument.
 *
 * TWO MEASURED TRAPS IN THAT INSTRUMENT, both worth knowing before editing it:
 *
 *   1. THE PAINTED RECT IS NOT THE LAYOUT RECT IN THIS HARNESS. `EQ_E2E=1` never shows the window,
 *      so it is never composited, and MUI's `Grow` transition freezes at its opening
 *      `scale(0.75, 0.5625)` — measured: the tooltip's computed transform stays that matrix
 *      forever, and a card whose layout box is 580px wide paints as 435px centred on the transform
 *      origin. That is a box 25% too SMALL and 37px too far right, which flatters every containment
 *      check ever written against it. So the box is reconstructed from the layout instead: climb
 *      the `offsetParent` chain to the POPPER — the outermost box below `body`, and the only one
 *      here whose transform is a pure TRANSLATE — and add the untransformed `offsetLeft/offsetTop`
 *      of everything below it. That is the geometry the user gets the moment the window paints.
 *      (Measured while writing this: the frozen scale sits on `.MuiTooltip-tooltip`, which is
 *      itself an `offsetParent`, so "the element's own offsetParent" is NOT far enough up.)
 *   2. THE ORDER IS READ AS COORDINATES, not as document order. "Item card, equipped card to its
 *      RIGHT" is the owner's ruling and a flex container can be told to reverse; the assertion is
 *      `item.right <= equipped.left`.
 *
 * WHAT ELSE NEEDS A REAL APP, given `tests/gearCompare.test.mts` owns the join, every word, and the
 * three source-pinned popper guarantees without a DOM:
 *
 *   1. A REAL POINTER ON A REAL ROW OPENS IT. The anchor, MUI's popper, the `plannerInventory` IPC
 *      and main's parse of the staged dump are four separate parts, and only a running app has all
 *      four.
 *   2. THE EQUIPPED CARD IS THE STAGED DUMP'S. The host spec stages the committed
 *      `Primitive_freeport-Inventory.txt` into the throwaway install, so `Primary  Thelvorn, Blade
 *      of Light +5` and `Secondary  Whitened Treant Fists` are facts on disk that have to travel
 *      main's parser, `equippedHosts`' cell assignment, the IPC and the renderer join to reach a
 *      hovered row. The number beside them is computed here from `scaleGearRow`, never typed.
 *   3. THE JOS-143 REGRESSION, WHICH IS THE STANDING RISK OF THE FEATURE. This table has carried
 *      "no popper on these dense rows" since it shipped, because twice (JOS-127, JOS-143) a card
 *      belonging to a row under a dropdown toolbar opened upward across it and ate the clicks aimed
 *      at the controls. So the pair is opened and then, WITH IT OPEN, the toolbar's era toggle and
 *      search box, the row's own wish heart (JOS-335) and the item name's Loot link are all
 *      hit-tested — `document.elementFromPoint` skips a `pointer-events: none` node, so this
 *      measures exactly what "the click still lands" means.
 *   4. IT CLOSES WHEN THE POINTER LEAVES (JOS-293's leave discipline, measured rather than trusted).
 *
 * IT LEAVES THE TAB AS IT FOUND IT: search box empty, both pickers cleared, the window back at the
 * size and minimum it arrived with, pointer parked off the table, no pair open — the steps after it
 * in `gear.e2e.mts` were written against that state.
