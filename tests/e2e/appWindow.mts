/**
 * appWindow.mts — THE APP UNDER TEST: which window is it, and a userData dir to start it from.
 *
 * Two helpers, their own file, because appHarness.mts is at the repo's 400-code-line factoring
 * ceiling and the answer to that is a split, not a widened threshold (the storeMigrations tests'
 * precedent). Both exist for the same reason: the app now opens a SECOND window at startup.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS (2026-08-05). `app.firstWindow()` resolves to whichever window Playwright
 * happened to attach to first, and for as long as this harness has existed that was trivially the
 * app: nothing else was open at startup. Then the celebration toast began defaulting to ON, so a
 * fresh launch creates a SECOND window — the transparent toast strip — moments after the first,
 * and the race is real. Specs began failing in a rotating cast of four or five per run, every one
 * of them with the same artifact DOM: `<div id="overlay-root"><div data-testid="toast-overlay">`.
 * Nothing was wrong with the app; the harness was asserting against the wrong window.
 *
 * The fix is to IDENTIFY the window instead of counting on ordering, and to identify it
 * POSITIVELY. `window.eq` is the main window's bridge alone — the overlays get `eqOverlay`, the
 * cursor ring `eqCursor`; three preloads, three worlds — so a page that answers to
 * `eq.getCombatSnapshot` is the app and nothing else can be. Polling covers the other half of the
 * race: at the instant a window appears its preload may not have run yet.

 * itself as part of the quit sequence. Every teardown this app hangs off that event (`stopSession`,

 * is the real user path — clicking the X — and it is the only one under which the last record of a
 * session is written.
 *
 * IT LIVES HERE, beside `launchApp`, rather than in the one spec that first needed it: a lesson
 * this expensive should have exactly one copy, and any spec that asserts about what a session
 * WROTE ON THE WAY OUT needs this exit rather than Playwright's. (It was
 * tests/e2e/telemetry.e2e.mts's private helper first; that spec now imports this one, unchanged.)
