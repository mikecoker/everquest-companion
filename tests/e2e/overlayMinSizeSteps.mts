// THE FLOOR IS ONLY A FLOOR IF THE WINDOW STILL WORKS AT IT (JOS-278).
//
// The 0.23.0 report behind this step: a player running Lossless Scaling gets the app's own minimum
// window size back MAGNIFIED along with the game, so the debuff strip could not be made narrow
// enough to sit beside the spellbar. The owner's ruling was to lower the floor, and the sanity
// condition attached to it was that the content degrade gracefully there — truncate, never overlap.
//
// The number itself is pinned where it lives (tests/overlayLayout.test.mts, `OVERLAY_MIN_SIZE`).
// What a pure test cannot say is the thing this ticket actually promised, so it is measured here,
// in a real window with a real layout engine: AT THE FLOOR, NOTHING THE USER HAS TO PRESS IS OFF
// THE WINDOW. That is not a hypothetical failure mode — it is the state this ticket found. At the
// OLD 200x90 floor the buffs, debuffs and XP windows already had their text-size stepper past the
// right edge (measured at x=237, 233 and 216 against a 200px window), clipped away by
// `overflow: hidden` in overlay.html with no scrollbar to reach it by. The floor came down anyway,
// which it could only do because the chrome learned to give way: the footer WRAPS
// (overlay/overlayScale.tsx `FOOTER_ROW`) and the header's drag gutter and kind tag shrink before
// the lock/close pair does (overlay/OverlayHeader.tsx).
//
// WHY EVERY BUTTON AND SLIDER, RATHER THAN A NAMED LIST: the failure is a layout overflow, and a
// layout overflow does not respect a list somebody wrote down. Every `<button>` and `<input>` in
// the surface is a control the user is meant to be able to hit, so every one of them is asked the
// same question — is your rectangle inside the window — on all four edges.
//
// AND THE CONTENT, SEPARATELY: rows are allowed to be taller than the pane (that is what the
// scroller is for) but they are NOT allowed to be wider than it. A row that runs wide is a name
// that failed to ellipsize, which is the "overlap, not truncate" half of the sanity condition.
//
// THE WINDOW IS DRIVEN THROUGH `setBounds`, i.e. through the same clamp a user's drag goes
// through: main is ASKED for something smaller than the floor and whatever it grants is what gets
// measured. So this step also proves the floor is enforced at all — a window that accepted 40x40
// would fail the size check below rather than quietly passing the layout one.
