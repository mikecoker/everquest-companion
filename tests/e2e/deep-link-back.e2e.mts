/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for DEEP-LINK BACK CONTINUITY (JOS-43).
 *
 * THE BUG, in the owner's words: drill into loot or a mob from elsewhere in the app, press Back,
 * and you are dumped at the top of the Loot/Mobs LIST — not where you came from. The contract the
 * app now keeps is that a cross-view deep link carries its ORIGIN and Back returns THERE, while
 * the list stays the back-target for a drill you genuinely opened from the list.
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN FILE, and not more steps bolted onto the Overview spec: the subject is the
 * NAVIGATION SEAM, not a surface. It crosses three tabs (Overview → Loot, Overview → Mobs, and
 * back again) and it is the one thing in the app whose correctness is a round TRIP rather than an
 * arrival. `overview.e2e.mts` is also within a few lines of the repo's `max-lines 400` ceiling,
 * which is the same reason that spec was split out of `combat-dashboard.e2e.mts`.
 *
 * WHY THE OVERVIEW IS THE SENDER HERE: it is the only tab that deep-links to BOTH receivers with
 * rows the log fills on its own — a recent drop opens the Loot drill, a recent kill opens the
 * Mob page. The planner→loot round trip is asserted where that link lives (`planner.e2e.mts`), and
 * the stack RULES themselves (what pushes, what clears, chaining, the bound) are pinned without a
 * browser in `tests/navOriginStack.test.mts`.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS (JOS-29): `tests/fixtures/e2e-deep-link.log` — 339 committed lines carrying two
 * loot lines off a credited Lord Nagafen kill, which is exactly the drop row and the kill row this
 * spec clicks. The steps keep their `note`-rather-than-red guards (the row is still a thing the
 * log has to have produced), but with a fixture the same branch is taken on every machine, every
 * run: the guards are honesty, not a lottery. What was never conditional is the DIRECTION of the
 * assertion — where Back went.
 *
 * SINCE JOS-201 IT ALSO OWNS THE MOUSE'S BACK BUTTON, and that is the right file rather than a new
 * one: mouse4 is not a second navigation model, it is a second way to press the SAME Back this spec
 * already drives, so the two belong under one round trip. What it can and cannot reach is spelled
 * out at `stepMouseBack`.
 *
 * WHY IT NEVER TAKES THE SCREEN: `EQ_E2E=1` (src/main/e2e.ts) shows no window, skips the
 * single-instance lock, and points `userData` at a throwaway temp dir minted per launch.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- deep-link`.
