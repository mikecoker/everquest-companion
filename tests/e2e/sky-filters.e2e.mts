/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for THE SKY TAB'S STICKY FILTERS (JOS-90, JOS-124, JOS-145).
 *
 * THE BUG, in the reporter's words: tick "Hide completed" on the Plane of Sky tab to see exactly
 * what is left, click away to any other tab, come back — and every quest you have already turned
 * in is on the screen again. Hiding completed steps is not a momentary filter, it is how a user
 * says "show me what is left", and the app forgot it the moment the view unmounted.
 *
 * WHY THE ROUND TRIP HAS TO BE DRIVEN BY A REAL APP. The unit-testable half of this is one line —
 * a `useState` initialiser reading localStorage — and a test of THAT would pass while the feature
 * stayed broken, because the bug was never in the read. It was in the LIFECYCLE: `App`'s
 * `ViewContent` mounts exactly one feature view at a time, so leaving the Sky tab destroys
 * `useQuestList` and everything it was holding. Only a spec that actually leaves the tab can
 * distinguish "the state is stored" from "the state survives being thrown away", which is why
 * every assertion below is bracketed by a NAVIGATION, and why the trip out asserts the filter bar
 * is GONE first — an unmount that never happened would make the rest of this spec a tautology.
 *
 * TWO LAUNCHES, ONE userData DIR. The tab round trip and the RESTART are different promises, and
 * a spec that only proved the first would leave "preferred, if that is where other view toggles
 * live" untested. `makeUserData()` hands both launches the same dir (the telemetry/overlay-sync
 * pattern), so launch 2 reads the localStorage launch 1 wrote — through a real process exit, not
 * a simulated one.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT ASSERT: which quests the tick removes from the list. That is
 * `selectQuests`'s filter, pinned without a browser in tests/questSort.test.mts, and repeating it
 * here would only make this spec depend on the committed quest data staying the shape it is.
 * The subject here is the STATE, and the state is what the box says.
 *
 * JOS-145 ADDS A SECOND HIDE-BOX beside the first ("hide quests I have turned in"), and with it the
 * one promise a per-control spec cannot make: that the two are INDEPENDENT. See
 * `stepBoxesAreIndependent` for why that is the assertion worth having and where the two boxes'
 * EFFECTS are pinned instead.
 *
 * JOS-124 ADDS THE BOSS AND ISLAND FACETS to the same subject, because they make the same promise
 * for a control with more to lose: a pick is a chip in a picker, and a picker that comes back empty
 * looks like the app forgot rather than like a filter cleared. Their step DOES read the counts line
 * ("N of M quests") — not to pin which quests survive (questFacets.test.mts owns that against the
 * committed data) but because a filter whose state persists while its EFFECT does not would pass
 * every localStorage assertion in this file. So the step asserts the relations only: picking
 * narrows, a second dimension narrows again, and clearing restores the number it started from.
 *
 * JOS-191 ADDS THE PAGE CAP to the same file, because it is the same subject read from the other
 * side: the thing the user asked for has to survive what the app does next. The cap was RESET BY
 * DATA — a star, a drop, a turn-in each rebuilt the filtered array and threw a fully paged-open
 * list back to the first forty rows — so the two steps here count ROWS rather than read a stored
 * bit, and the stored bit ("show all") is checked on top because the preference is the second half
 * of the ask. See `stepShowAllSurvivesInteraction`.
 *
 * JOS-206 ADDS ONE MORE ROW-COUNTING STEP for the same reason JOS-191's are here: typing in the
 * search box stalled the app, and the largest single cause was that a COLLAPSED quest's panel was
 * still in the DOM being reconciled. The fix is structural and so is the assertion —
 * `stepCollapsedRowsDrawNoPanel` counts a panel-only control before, during and after an expand.
 * The milliseconds are deliberately not in here; they are a machine's number, and this file's job
 * is the promise that number rests on.
 *
 * JOS-207 ADDS THE SEARCH BOX to the facet steps, because it is now reading the facets' own data:
 * a boss name typed into the box has to find the same quests picking that boss does. That is an
 * equality between two controls rather than a count, which is exactly the kind of claim this file
 * is for — the counts stay out of it and live in tests/questSearch.test.mts. See
 * `stepSearchFindsBossesAndIslands`.
 *
 * WHY IT NEVER TAKES THE SCREEN: `EQ_E2E=1` (src/main/e2e.ts) shows no window, skips the
 * single-instance lock, and points `userData` at a throwaway temp dir minted per launch.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- sky-filters` (or node --import tsx this file).

 * because its dependency changed. The defect is what the two of them MEAN together, which is only
 * visible with a real list, a real click, and a count of what is left mounted afterwards.
 *
 * The expanded row is half the report and gets its own assertion: rows past the cap UNMOUNT when it
 * snaps back, so an open accordion at row 61 is destroyed rather than closed. It is opened at the
 * BOTTOM of the list precisely because that is the region the old behaviour could not keep.

/**
 * THE JOS-207 ASK: the search box finds bosses and islands too.
 *
 * The owner's report was that typing a boss name into the Sky search box returned nothing, in an
 * app that already knew perfectly well which quests that boss stands in front of — the fact was
 * there, behind a dropdown, and the box did not read it. The fix routes the query through the same
 * `questBosses`/`questIslands` the pickers are built from, so there is one truth per quest rather
 * than two mappings that can drift.
 *
 * WHY THE ASSERTION IS AN EQUALITY BETWEEN TWO CONTROLS rather than a count. Which quests a boss
 * stands in front of is committed data, and tests/questSearch.test.mts pins that without a browser
 * (sixteen for this boss, and not one of them findable by the three fields the box searched
 * before). What only a real app can say is that the two controls AGREE: picking the boss and
 * typing his name narrow the same list to the same size, through two different code paths that
 * would each look correct in isolation if they had drifted apart. `Gorgalosk` is the name chosen
 * precisely because it appears in no quest name, no reward and no item name in the whole file, so
 * the equality is exact rather than a superset — a name like "Spiroc" is also an item word, and
 * the box is right to answer with the union there.
 *
 * Starts and ends with every filter cleared, so `stepArmRestart` below still starts from the long
 * list it expects.
