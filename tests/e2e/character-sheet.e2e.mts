/**
 * THE CHARACTER TAB IS RELEASED (JOS-327) — and this spec is the inverse of the one it replaces.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE USED TO BE. From JOS-45 the character sheet was UNRELEASED: it lived behind a
 * compile-time strip and this spec measured that promise on the emitted bundle, launching TWICE —
 * once production-shaped to watch the tab be ABSENT and the IPC channel REFUSE, then again with
 * `EQ_UNRELEASED=1` to watch the same channel answer, because an absence assertion passes just as
 * happily when the feature was never wired up at all. Absent, then present, on one build: that was
 * a gate rather than dead code.
 *
 * The owner released the tab on 2026-08-13. Every one of those claims is now false BY DESIGN, so
 * the file states the opposite ones and states them the same way — not "the tab exists" (which a
 * misspelled testid satisfies) but the tab exists, mounts a sheet built from a KNOWN dump, draws
 * the exaltations socketed into it, and its ledger answers a search with a number this spec can
 * predict. The gate machinery itself survives tenantless (src/main/unreleased.ts); the day a
 * surface adopts it, the two-launch spec gets written again against that surface's own channel.
 *
 * AND IT LAUNCHES ON A STAGED DUMP NOW, which is the other half of the rewrite. The old spec ran
 * `launchApp()` against whatever the machine happened to have, so every content assertion had to
 * be an identity or a `note()` that asserts nothing — on a machine with no `/outputfile inventory`
 * dump it skipped the interesting half entirely. `launchOnFixture(…, { inventory })` stages the
 * committed 295-line dump into a throwaway EQ install, so the numbers below are EXACT and the same
 * on every machine: 24 cells, 22 of them filled, 6 socketed exaltations, 123 things carried.
 *
 * WHERE IT LOOKS. The sheet has no nav row of its own — JOS-324 collapsed four rows into the gear
 * area — so the entry is two clicks: `nav-gear`, then `tab-character`, which is the area's LAST
 * tab. The spec waits for `tab-gear` in between, so the bar whose contents it is about to assert on
 * is demonstrably on screen at the moment of the assertion.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- character-sheet` (or node --import tsx this file).
