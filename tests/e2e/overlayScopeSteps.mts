// WHOSE DAMAGE, AND WHAT ITS OLD ROOM BECAME — the overlay half of JOS-115 and JOS-121.
//
// Two steps, one subject. JOS-115 retired the overlay's inline scope CONTROL and left the WORD as
// a read-only tag in the meter's header row; JOS-121 took the word out of that row entirely and
// put it on the panel floor, then split the freed width between the fight selector and the drag
// surface. So `stepOverlayScope` asserts WHERE the word is and that it still crosses windows, and
// `stepTitleBarRoom` MEASURES what the title bar did with what it got back.
//
// Its own module because tests/e2e/overlay-sync.e2e.mts sits at the repo's max-lines budget:
// split, never ratchet (drill.mts and combatPrefsSteps.mts set the precedent).
//
// `setLocked` is passed IN rather than re-implemented: the spec owns the lock helper because
// several of its other steps need it, and two definitions of "the lock has taken effect in this
// renderer" is exactly the drift that would make one of them lie.

 * The overlay used to carry a one-click CYCLE writing a key of its own kind. The owner retired

 * moved rooms, not wires, and this step still drives the real preferences control to prove it.

 * What JOS-121 changed is WHERE the word is, and the rule that came with the move: it no longer
 * vanishes when the overlay is LOCKED. It is a watermark you read rather than chrome you reach
 * for, and a pinned meter is the one with no selector, no controls and no tooltip left to explain
