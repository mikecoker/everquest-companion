// DRIVING THE COMBAT PREFERENCES FROM THE REAL UI (JOS-115).
//
// The You / Group / Everyone scope used to be a chip on every combat surface; it is now ONE
// preference in Preferences > Combat, read by the Combat tab, the Overview card and every floating
// overlay. That makes "set it" a two-window act rather than a click on the surface under test, so
// the door is here and every spec that needs it walks through the same one.
//
// IT CLICKS THE ACTUAL CONTROL, never `localStorage.setItem`. The write path is half the claim —
// a preference that persists but does not APPLY is the defect this ticket exists to avoid — and
// the cross-window half (the overlay hearing about it through the DOM's own 'storage' event, no
// IPC involved) can only be exercised by a real write from the main window's document.
//
// Its own module because combatSteps.mts and every e2e spec that would otherwise host it sit at
// or near the repo's max-lines budget: split, never ratchet (drill.mts set the precedent).
