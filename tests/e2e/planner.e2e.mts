/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for THE EXALTATIONS TAB AND THE WISH LIST — two tabs of the
 * gear area, one feature, one launch (JOS-326; docs/plans/exaltation-planner.md §9).
 *
 * WHAT THIS SPEC BECAME. It used to drive a planner with three modes over a selected SET: Effects
 * picked what you wanted, Inventory laid it over the gear you were wearing, Farm turned what was
 * missing into a route. JOS-326 removed the set switcher, the mode toggle, the board and the Farm
 * tab: Exaltations is a SEARCH SURFACE now, and what you found there goes on a flat WISH LIST one
 * tab over, which inherited the zone rollup. So this spec walks the feature the way a player does
 * — browse, add, cross to the list, and see the route.
 *
 * THE PLAN BOARD'S CLAIMS WENT WITH THE PLAN BOARD, and the removals are stated rather than
 * silently dropped: the board's cells and pairs, the host picker, the socket preset, the planned
 * exaltation's hover line, the add button's Replace warning and the Farm rollup are gone from the
 * product, so their steps are gone from here (plannerSteps.mts lists them, with what still covers
 * the model underneath and the one assertion that wants re-homing).
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN FILE: one spec per surface, all of them sharing `appHarness.mts` and running back to
 * back from `npm run test:e2e`. `EQ_E2E=1` (src/main/e2e.ts) shows no window, skips the
 * single-instance lock and points `userData` at a throwaway temp dir, so this runs invisibly beside
 * the user's game and dev app.
 *
 * WHY THE STORE IS WRITTEN BEFORE THE LAUNCH. The wish list SEEDS ITSELF ONCE from the exaltation
 * sets a user had planned — that is how the board's removal keeps their work — and nothing in the
 * product can create a set any more. So this spec owns its `userData` dir and writes one plan into
 * it first. That is the only way an app can reach the import at all, and it is why the dir is
 * `makeUserData()`'s rather than the launcher's.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS, against the REAL committed item DB: the Gear nav row plus the Exaltations tab
 * mounts the pane; the pane is SEARCH-ONLY (no set chip, no mode toggle, no board, no rollup) and
 * still carries the class filter over the effect list; the browser lists at least one effect row
 * and expands it into at least one donor (asserted as a FLOOR, never as today's count); a majority
 * of donor rows state what their effect DOES, in one line joined from the committed spell DB; the
 * era filter is ON by default and actually removes rows when switched off; the non-equippable
 * escape hatch is off by default and only ever adds; the Focus tab opens on FAMILIES with the best
 * tier of each crowned; any item the DB carries can narrow the list, and that narrowing survives a
 * switch between the effect kinds (JOS-210, both halves); ADDING a donor puts it on the wish list
 * and turns its own row to `Wished`; the wish list carries the one-time plan import LABELLED, groups
 * its rows by zone without ever heading a zone this era cannot reach, searches the WHOLE corpus
 * from one add control (gear rows and donors together), refuses a second wish for the same item,
 * searches its own rows, removes one, and deep-links every name into the Loot drill-down; and the
 * exaltation rules card is NOT up on a first visit, comes up only from the toolbar's `?`, and
 * closes for good when dismissed (V10 as JOS-51 revised it).
 *
 * The one thing it deliberately does NOT assert is which effects or donors are on screen: a
 * rescrape may re-word an effect, and a spec that pinned today's proc names would rot (AGENTS.md:
 * frozen numbers rot).
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- planner`.
