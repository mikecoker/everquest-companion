/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for PERFORMANCE PROFILING (docs/plans/perf-profiling.md, P7).
 *
 * WHY IT IS AN E2E SPEC AND NOT A UNIT TEST: every claim this feature makes is a SEAM.
 *   - "the chip is absent by default" is a claim about a fresh install's store, an IPC handler,
 *     a push channel that stays silent, and a component that renders null. Only the real app
 *     can show that nothing appears.
 *   - "it appears once you enable it" crosses the Preferences pane, a store write, a sampler
 *     that must START in the same call (not on the next launch), `app.getAppMetrics()`, and a
 *     push. A mocked version of that would be asserting the mock.
 *   - "the popover renders NUMBERS" is the whole point of a HUD, and the numbers come from
 *     Electron's own metrics — there is nowhere else to get them.
 *   - "every launch leaves a startup profile with monotonic phases" is a claim about a FILE
 *     written by a real boot, so it is read off disk, from the userData dir this run used.
 *
 * Identities only, never today's numbers: memory is asserted to be positive and phases to be
 * ordered, never to equal a figure that depends on the machine this ran on.
 *
 * Run: `node --import tsx tests/e2e/perf.e2e.mts` (it is also in tests/e2e/run-all.mts).
