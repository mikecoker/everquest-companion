// STEPS OF THE COMBAT-DASHBOARD SPEC that live next door, because combat-dashboard.e2e.mts sits
// AT the repo max-lines budget and the rule here is to split, never ratchet (drill.mts set the
// precedent). Each function below is one numbered step of that run, moved verbatim except where
// noted; the spec still owns the ORDER.
//
// ── THE COMBAT TAB'S HEALING DIMENSION, end to end (P2 of docs/plans/combat-overlay-parity.md —
// owner ruling: "the combat panel lacks the overlay's HEAL functionality — parity").
//
// The builder and every word it prints are pinned purely in tests/healRows.test.mts, including
// the one-builder seam that keeps the panel and the floating heal overlays rendering from the
// same function. What only the real app can show is that the third position of the direction
// filter is WIRED: the panel swaps to a healing list, its headline switches units to `hps` (a
// heal rate must never be readable as dps), and the copy affordance — which serializes damage
// tables only — stands down rather than putting the wrong view on the clipboard.
//
// The CONTENT is log-dependent (a session with no heals legitimately renders the quiet empty
// state), so nothing here asserts rows — only that the dimension exists and behaves.

 * JOS-47 shipped a QUESTION here: an unbound pet-shaped entity fighting beside you put
 * "<Name> — your pet?" above the bars, with Yes and No. The owner cut it —
 *
 *     "just cut out the 'is this my pet question' - if you just have to pet attack once,
 *      this is a lot of work we can get wrong."
 *
 * — so this step asserts an ABSENCE and then a CURE, which is the pair that says the deletion
 * was clean rather than merely quiet. An absence is asserted with the settle vocabulary
 * (`settleStable`: wait for the reading to stop changing, THEN assert nothing is there), never
 * by looking once and finding nothing yet.
 *
 * The pet is written by the harness (gameplay.playPetPull): a proper-named entity that fights the
 * two mobs you fight, never swings at you, and speaks one of the six pet-voiced sentences — the
 * strongest evidence the old detector had, and now inert. Then `playPetOrder` orders it, and the
 * private tell it answers with is the one line in this log that binds a summoned pet.

// ── THE DPS LEGEND SWITCHES ITS OWN LINES OFF (JOS-264) ────────────────────────────────────
//
// From a report of the chart read from across a room: four curves plus four marker colours in one
// small plot, and the ask was to be able to put some of it away. The geometry is node-tested
// (tests/dpsChartLines.test.mts) and so is the stored vocabulary (tests/combatPrefs.test.mts).
// What only the real app can show is the part those two cannot see:
//   * the legend entry is WIRED to the drawing — a click removes that line's element from the SVG;
//   * hiding is REVERSIBLE, because the entry it was made from is still on screen (dimmed) rather
//     than deleted. A legend that removed its own entries would be a one-way door, and no unit
//     test can tell "styled as off" from "gone";
//   * it SURVIVES THE TAB SWITCH, which is the whole reason this is a stored pref rather than a
//     useState (AGENTS.md: prove it by navigating and asserting the view was GONE first);
//   * and ALL LINES OFF renders a card, not a crash or an empty box.
//
// It leaves the legend exactly as it found it, so no step after this one inherits a hidden line.
