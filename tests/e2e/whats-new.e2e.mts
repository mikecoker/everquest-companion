/**
 * WHAT'S NEW, driven through the real app (JOS-73).
 *
 * `tests/releaseNotes.test.mts` pins the derivation as pure logic, which is most of the feature.
 * What a unit test structurally cannot see is the part this spec exists for: the whole promise
 * rests on a STORE KEY that main owns, read once at launch, and the two most load-bearing claims
 * are about a launch rather than about a function.
 *
 *   1. A FRESH INSTALL IS NOT TOLD IT WAS UPDATED. The e2e channel gives every launch its own
 *      temp userData (src/main/channel.ts), so this run IS a fresh install — no stub, no seeded
 *      state, no flag. The teaser strip must be absent, and the panel must mark nothing new. If
 *      the absent-key case ever reads as "everything is new", this is where it shows up, and it
 *      would show up as the first sentence the app ever says to a new user.
 *   2. …AND AN UPGRADED INSTALL IS. The stamp is written through the same bridge method the
 *      panel and the teaser's dismiss use, the window is RELOADED (the state is read once per
 *      launch, on purpose — features/whatsnew/session.ts), and the strip has to come back naming
 *      the newest release with the right releases marked behind it.
 *
 * It also asserts the DEV variant control is ABSENT here, for the same reason the feedback spec
 * asserts `nav-triage` is: this build is production-shaped, and "compiled out" is a claim about
 * bytes that only a build can answer.
 *
 * JOS-254 adds the two ends of "patch notes, one click from the version number":
 *
 *   3. THE ICON IS BESIDE THE VERSION NUMBER AND IT OPENS THE PANEL. Both halves are geometry
 *      and navigation, which is exactly what a unit test cannot see — "next to" is a rendered
 *      relationship between two boxes, and the click crosses the nav → Preferences → section
 *      seam that only the real app has.
 *   4. …AND THE PANEL CARRIES A WAY OUT TO GITHUB. The href is checked against
 *      `allowedExternalUrl` — main's OWN boundary, imported here — because a link this app
 *      renders but main refuses to open is a dead control that looks alive, and that is the
 *      failure mode a rendered-attribute check alone would miss.
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e -- whats-new`
