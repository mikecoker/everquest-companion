// buffTimerSteps — reading a TIMER OVERLAY's rows out of the DOM, and setting its arrangement.
//
// Its own module for the reason `combatSteps.mts` and `overlayScopeSteps.mts` are: the spec that
// uses it is at the repo's 400-code-line factoring ceiling, and a reader with two arrangements to
// cope with is exactly the kind of thing that belongs beside the other readers rather than inside
// the narrative of a spec.
//
// TWO ARRANGEMENTS, ONE READER (JOS-140). The debuffs window opens FLAT — one list sorted soonest
// to expire, with the enemy as a chip ON the row — and can be switched to per-target BLOCKS, where
// the enemy is a heading above a group of rows. `targets()` answers "which enemy" from either, so
// a spec's claim about what the user can see does not have to restate the arrangement it is in.

 * `ReferenceError: __name is not defined` from inside Playwright's evaluate wrapper.
