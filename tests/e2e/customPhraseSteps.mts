/**
 * JOS-360 — WRITING A CUSTOM SPOKEN PHRASE, FROM THE ROW AND FROM THE EDITOR.
 *
 * THE OWNER'S RULING (2026-08-14, hands-on, release-blocking): "we lost the ability to write custom
 * spoken alerts. we must retain that. and we must be able to parse {target} and such in those
 * custom alerts."
 *
 * THE REGRESSION THIS REPRODUCES. The alert ROW's "Speak: custom…" entry opened its phrase popover
 * from the Select's `onChange`, and a MUI Select fires `onChange` only when the value CHANGES. A
 * def already sitting at `speech.mode:'custom'` therefore had a DEAD entry — clicking it did
 * nothing, so the phrase could not be reworded without opening the editor. It was survivable while
 * `landsOnOther` was the only suggestion template that shipped a phrase; JOS-347 and JOS-353 gave
 * six more templates a default `{target}` phrase, so every suggestion a user installs now arrives
 * in custom mode and every one of them hit the dead entry. The unit half — the state, the round
 * trip through parser/module/resolver, the no-clobber rule — is tests/customSpeechAuthoring.test.
 * mts. What only the real app can show is that a CLICK on that entry opens the popover at all,
 * which is why this is an e2e claim and not a unit one.
 *
 * A STEP MODULE RATHER THAN A SPEC (the alwaysPlayAllSteps.mts / targetTokenSteps.mts precedent):
 * everything it needs — a launched app, a staged log it can append to, the Alerts tab, the engine
 * seam's utterance ring — is already standing in voice-alerts.e2e.mts, and that spec is at its
 * 400-line budget. A second Electron launch to type one sentence would buy nothing but 40 seconds.
 *
 * THE DEF IS SHAPED LIKE A SUGGESTION AS AN OLDER BUILD SAVED IT: an `audio:'both'` fade alert
 * carrying the template's own `{target}` phrase (suggestions.ts). That was the def the owner had
 * in his hands, and it is now also the MIGRATION case — JOS-362 retired the combined channel, so
 * a stored 'both' has to resolve on read (`resolveAlertAudio`: a phrase means spoken). The walk
 * therefore starts one step earlier than his did: the row must already read "Voice (spoken)" and
 * show the say picker, with no channel switch available to make it do so.
 *
 * THE LINE IS EQ'S OWN `Your <Spell> spell has worn off of <mob>.`, which the parser reads as a
 * `buffFade` naming the mob — the same family the fade suggestion watches. Restamped to now by the
 * harness, because the module fires live-only.
