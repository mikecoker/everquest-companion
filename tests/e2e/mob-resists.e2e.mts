// THE RESISTS CARD, IN THE REAL APP (JOS-382).
//
// What a fixture replay cannot see: that the card MOUNTS on the mob page, that it draws five axis
// rows whether or not there is anything behind them, that the number and its interval and its
// count are all on screen together, and that no acronym reaches a player's eye. The estimator's
// arithmetic is pinned by tests/resistModel.test.mts against synthetic rolls; this spec is about
// what the screen says.
//
// IT STATES EXACT NUMBERS, and it is allowed to: nothing here is read off the player's live log.
// The rows come from the COMMITTED baseline (src/main/data/resistBaseline.json), the mob comes
// from the committed catalog, and the fixture log is the same one the deep-link spec uses. The one
// thing that is not committed is the client's own `spells_us.txt`, which this repo may not carry —
// the harness symlinks the real install's copy in (`{ spells: true }`, the same carve-out the map
// packs get), and on a machine with no EverQuest installed the spec asserts the app's honest
// degraded branch instead. That branch is a supported configuration in its own right: an
// install-dir override pointed at a folder of logs has no spell data behind it either.
//
// AND THE CARD NO LONGER WITHHOLDS AN ANSWER (owner ruling, 2026-08-16, landed with JOS-383). The
// n >= 5 floor this spec was first written against is gone: an axis with any observation prints its
// tag, its number, its interval and its count, with a quieter "low samples" caveat below ten, and
// only an empty axis says "no data". `stepThinRow` is where that shows.
//
// AND THE THIRD EVIDENCE FAMILY HAS ITS OWN LINE (JOS-385). Charmed pets and NPC casters are
// folded like any other observation and a preference decides whether the estimator weighs them, so
// the two things this spec has to see are the LINE on the drilldown and the SWITCH that changes
// what it says. The switch is the only claim here no unit test can make: that the preference the
// card reads is the preference the Preferences pane writes.
//
// Run: `npm run test:e2e -- mob-resists`
