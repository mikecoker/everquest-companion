// BEST AT THIS LEVEL (JOS-445, four tabs since JOS-448) — the right column's efficiency readout,
// asserted on screen.
//
// Its own file for the reason `unlockRowSteps.mts` is: leveling.e2e.mts sits AT the repo max-lines
// budget and the rule here is to SPLIT, never ratchet. The spec still owns the order and the launch.
//
// WHAT THIS PROVES THAT NO UNIT TEST CAN. `tests/bestSpells.test.mts` pins the ranking, the era
// split and the null-last sort over the committed corpus. What it cannot reach is the SEAM, and the
// seam is where every part of this ticket lives:
//   * main now ships the hitpoint LINES beside the gain-level snapshot (`UnlockSpell.hpLines`), so
//     a renderer can evaluate a ramp at a level main never picked. A dataset built without them
//     draws a readout with no rows at all, and no unit test of either half would notice.
//   * the level is the TAB'S now, not the unlock panel's — one stepper, two columns. The only way
//     to assert that is to press the stepper and watch the OTHER column follow.
//   * the sort is a click on a header, and re-ranking is the owner's whole ask.
//   * and since JOS-448 the four answers live behind four TABS, so only one table is in the DOM at
//     a time. That the other three are not merely hidden but absent, that their counts are still
//     stated on the labels, and that a click swaps the table under the same headers, are all claims
//     about the rendered document rather than about the model.
//   * and since JOS-447 there is a SLIDER in that 260px column. The model half is pinned in
//     `tests/bestSpellsRank.test.mts`; what only the app can show is that the control is drawn at
//     all, that its label is permanent rather than appearing on drag, that the label NAMES the rank
//     and the one axis it moves, and that the numbers under it restate when it is driven.
//
// SHAPES AND ORDERINGS, NEVER TODAY'S NUMBERS. The loadout is whatever this machine's log inferred
// and the figures come from the committed catalog, so the assertions are that the drawn column is
// MONOTONE under its own sort and that pressing another header changes which monotone it is. A
// wrong figure is the unit suite's job; a table that is not sorted by the column it says it is
// sorted by is this step's.
//
// AND IT LEAVES THE TAB WHERE IT FOUND IT: the level is stepped once and stepped back, because the
// steps around it make claims about the level the panel was left on.
