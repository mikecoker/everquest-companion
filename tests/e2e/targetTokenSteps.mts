/**
 * JOS-353 — `{target}` FROM THE PLAIN EDITOR, ON A LIVE-TAILED LINE.
 *
 * A step module rather than a spec of its own (the alwaysPlayAllSteps.mts precedent, and the same
 * arithmetic): everything it needs — a launched app, a staged log it can append to, the Alerts tab,
 * the engine seam's utterance ring — is already standing in voice-alerts.e2e.mts, and that spec is
 * at its 400-line budget. A second Electron launch to say one sentence would buy nothing but 40
 * seconds.
 *
 * WHY IT IS AN E2E CLAIM AT ALL. tests/alertTargetToken.test.mts pins every link of the chain in
 * isolation — the table, the sentinels, the sanitizer, the module's firing, the resolver's output.
 * What no unit can see is the TRIP: `FiredAlert.captures` is JSON over IPC, the renderer's player
 * holds its own copy of the defs, and the value only leaves main if the def's phrase asked for it
 * (a compile-time gate in the alerts module). A hand-off that dropped the derived key would
 * type-check perfectly and ship an alert that speaks the literal characters `{target}` — which is
 * exactly the failure the owner's ruling exists to prevent. Only the real app can show the mob's
 * name coming out the far end.
 *
 * THE DEF HAS NO REGEX IN IT, and that is the whole assertion. An event kind and two literal
 * `where` values — the plain condition editor's own output shape. §5 of the host spec proves a
 * DECLARED capture group survives the trip; this proves the UNDECLARED one does, which is the
 * difference the ticket is about.
 *
 * THE LINE IS THE REPORTERS' OWN SENTENCE. `Your <hold> spell has worn off of <mob>.` is what both
 * "Mez has dropped on a ghoul" and "Soothe has worn off a Fire Giant" are — a `cc` break, which
 * spells its entity `mob` rather than `target`. That the user never has to know that is the point
 * of the table in shared/alertTargets.ts.
 *
 * IT ASSERTS THE EDITOR TOO. A token nobody is told about is a token nobody uses, so the second
 * half re-opens the def in the real dialog and reads the auto-token hint off the real DOM.
