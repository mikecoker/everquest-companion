// THE GEAR AREA'S FORM MEMORY — the restart split, and what every stored key does when the value
// it reads back is rubbish (JOS-329).
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The ticket persists eleven new fields across four tabs, and every one of
// them reads from a store the user can edit, a previous build can have written, and a crash can
// have truncated. `gearPrefs.ts` set the rule the whole area now follows — A STORED VALUE DEGRADES,
// IT NEVER ERRORS (JOS-105) — and the only way that rule stays true across eleven keys is if each
// one is driven through its garbage cases by something that runs in a millisecond.
//
// WHAT IS ASSERTED, in one sentence per claim:
//
//   1. THE SPLIT IS DATA. `AREA_FORM_TIER` is the ONE statement of which fields survive a restart,
//      so the test reads it as a table rather than re-asserting the rule per call site: every
//      search key is `session`, every structural key is `restart`, and there is no third tier.
//   2. GARBAGE IN, DEFAULTS OUT — for all eleven keys, over one shared corpus of hostile values
//      (`GARBAGE`), so a twelfth key added without a sanitizer cannot quietly pass by being
//      forgotten: it has to be added to a table here to be covered.
//   3. A GOOD VALUE SURVIVES INTACT, which is the half a "never throws" test can accidentally
//      satisfy by returning the default for everything.
//   4. THE THREE DISTINCTIONS THAT ARE EASY TO ERASE, each of which is a real bug if it goes:
//      absent-vs-pinned-empty on the gear class filter, `null`-as-"All slots" on the browse form,
//      and era's default being ON rather than the `false` a naive `=== true` would produce.
//   5. THE SLIDER IS VALIDATED BY `normalizeUpgradeState` AND NOTHING ELSE — the overridden law
//      (gearData.ts) persists a control whose vocabulary is 1,024 states, so an out-of-range store
//      has to come back as a REACHABLE state rather than as a number the scaler will believe.
//
// Pure model only: `areaMemory.ts` touches no React, no storage and no IPC, so it runs under the
// node runner like `gearPrefs` and `gearFilter` before it. Nothing here mounts a component — the
// away-and-back behaviour those keys exist FOR is an e2e claim (gear/planner/character specs), and
// a unit test of the read passing while the feature stays broken is exactly what the JOS-90 law
// warns about.
