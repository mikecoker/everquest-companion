// JOS-396 — THE CLIENT'S HITPOINT SLOTS REACHING THE ROW, end to end.
//
// THE REPORT: a shaman hits 43, the Leveling panel offers Odium, and the row shows no damage. The
// cause is not a bug in the reader — the wiki's slot table for Odium lists `Increase Curse Counter
// by 8` and no hitpoint line at all, so `spellMetrics` correctly answered "no figures" about a
// page that states none. The client's own `spells_us.txt` has the number the game prints.
//
// THE CLAIMS PINNED HERE are the DELIVERY ones; the arithmetic belongs to tests/spellMetrics.test.mts
// (R9-R13) and the field map to tests/spellsUsParse.test.mts:
//
//   1. THE JOIN IS THE CANONICAL KEY. A miss here fails SILENTLY — the row simply keeps showing
//      nothing, which is the exact defect the ticket exists to fix — so it is asserted rather than
//      assumed (law 2: names are dirty, canonicalised at boundaries).
//   2. THE ROW AND THE CARD SHOW THE SAME NUMBERS, because one function computes them.
//   3. A FOLD THAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE CLIENT TABLE LANDED IS REBUILT WHEN IT DOES. The table is
//      parsed on a worker and takes a moment on a cold launch; the unlock dataset is cached for the
//      life of the process, so without this a player who opened the Leveling tab in that window
//      would keep the empty row for the rest of the run.
//   4. NOTHING THAT ALREADY HAD WIKI FIGURES MOVES. The wiki stays primary — acceptance 3.
//
// No Electron, no filesystem: the client table below is ONE hand-written entry, transcribed from
// spell 4093 of the owner's install on 2026-08-16 (the same row tests/spellsUsParse.test.mts pins).
// Both call sites take the table as an ARGUMENT precisely so this suite never needs the 38 MB file.
//
// Run: `npm test`.

// of the committed catalog needs it today. Exactly two spells whose page omits `recast_time` carry
// a hitpoint line at all — `Call of Sky Strike` and `Call of Fire Strike`, both ranger procs — and
// the owner's own `spells_us.txt` states 0 in field 10 for both of them, which is the same answer
// as silence. So this is STRUCTURALLY covered and unobserved on today's data (the awaiting-sample
// law), and the row below is hand-authored to say so out loud rather than transcribed.
