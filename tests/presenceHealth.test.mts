// THE WATCHER'S EXIT, AND THE LOOP IT CAN GET STUCK IN (JOS-164, retargeted by JOS-182).
//
// Split out of `tests/presence.test.mts` for size, and it is a clean seam: everything here is
// about the watcher ENDING — the reason it announces, and the trail that recognises a run of
// immediate exits. The line protocol, the EQ-window predicate, the debounce and the gating matrix
// stay in the original file.
//
// WHAT CHANGED UNDER IT, AND WHAT DID NOT. This file used to be `presenceSelfReap.test.mts` and
// its second half read the PowerShell the watcher child ran, asserting that it never asked .NET
// about a process again. There is no child and no PowerShell any more, so those assertions are
// gone — replaced by `tests/presenceNative.test.mts`, which calls the real Win32 surface that took
// their place, and `tests/presenceWorker.test.mts`, which runs the real worker.
//
// The FOLD is what survived, and deliberately: the sequence it recognises — a watcher that starts,
// says why it cannot work, and exits cleanly, forever, on the restart backoff — is not specific to
// a self-reaping child. It is what a machine whose native surface will not load does, which is the
// same population of machines (a locked-down enterprise desktop, a Wine prefix) that produced the
// bug in the first place.
//
// AND SINCE JOS-310 IT ALSO COVERS THE DEMOTION. The went-silent restart is the EXPECTED,
// self-healing half of this same watchdog and is no longer reported as an error; what every
// restart carries instead — the cause — is pinned at the bottom of this file, along with the
// source pin that says which of the four sites is `logInfo` and which three are still `logError`.
//
// PURE, and it never skips.
