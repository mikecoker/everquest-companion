// TELEMETRY.md ↔ the schema — plan decision T4's "so it cannot drift".
//
// TELEMETRY.md is a PROMISE to users about what this app is allowed to measure. A hand-written
// promise about a machine-readable schema is a promise that goes stale on the first PR that
// forgets it, and a stale privacy doc is worse than none: it is a claim the code no longer
// makes. So the doc is GENERATED (`npm run gen:telemetry-doc`) and this suite is the lock —
// change the schema without regenerating and the suite is red, with the fix in its message.
//
// It checks three different things, and they fail for three different reasons:
//   * COMPLETENESS — every event kind in the union has a doc row, in the union's own order.
//     Fails when someone adds an event and no doc entry.
//   * PARITY — the committed bytes equal a fresh render. Fails when someone edits either side.
//   * SUBSTANCE — the rendered page actually names every enum member and bucket edge the
//     schema has. Fails if the renderer ever stops reaching into the schema and starts
//     describing it from memory, which is the failure mode generation exists to prevent.
