// world model against hand-verified time spans of the user's actual log.
//
// The fixtures under tests/fixtures/*.log are trimmed excerpts of the real
// eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt (third-party chat/social dropped by the shared scrub
// tests/fixture-scrub.mjs; every buff/entity-relevant line kept). They are COMMITTED — the
// repo is public, so regenerate them only through tests/extract-*.mjs, which all route
// through that scrub. Each golden test documents the raw line range it was cut from and the sequence
// it hand-verifies. This is the methodology the user mandated: never trust the model —
// pin it to real log windows a human read line-by-line.

/**
 * Replay raw log lines through the real parser + BuffsModule and return the final
 * snapshot state. `finalTickMs`, when given, fires one `onTick(finalTickMs)` after the
 * fold — modeling the wall-clock heartbeat the live app runs (so a cast in the last 15s
 * confirms, and overdue actives get swept) at a chosen observation instant.
 *
 * `opts.prime` is an EARLIER real log excerpt replayed through the SAME module first, to
 * establish learned state (everFaded / spell class / recognized landing emotes) before
 * the window — exactly as the full-log replay does ahead of the live tail in production.
 * The long inter-day gap between a priming excerpt and its window naturally trips the
 * ≥30-min session-gap clear, which wipes stale ACTIVES/entities but PRESERVES the learned
 * maps (that's the point of priming): the window starts from a clean active set with a
 * warm classifier.
 *
 * THE SPELL DB IS INSTALLED, because production installs it (JOS-118). This replay used to
 * clear it deliberately — "the W1–W6 windows assert the pre-DB cast-timing/emote path" — which
 * modelled a configuration the app has not run since Task #34: `installSpellDb` fires at main
 * startup, so the live parser ALWAYS has the DB and always emits the message-driven
 * `buffApply`/`buffWearOff` events. With the DB cleared, no landing line parses at all, and the
 * only thing that could ever open an instance was the cast-timing INFERENCE — the optimistic
 * provisional JOS-118 deletes, and the source of the resisted-debuff bar the owner reported.
 * So these windows were pinning the fallback rather than the behaviour. They keep their real
 * bytes and their assertions; what changed is that they now run the configuration the user has.

 *
 * `until` stops the fold at an instant (inclusive), which is how a per-target mez is observed
 * BEFORE and AFTER its break line without cutting a second fixture. `tickMs` fires the wall-clock
 * heartbeat both modules take, modelling an idle log at a chosen observation instant.
 *
 * `ticks` fires the heartbeat MID-FOLD, at each listed instant, just before the first event at or
 * after it — which is the only way to model what production actually does between two log lines
 * (JOS-180 needed it: a hold has to be culled by the 1 s heartbeat BEFORE its wear-off arrives, or
 * the test proves the cull and the late join in one event and never shows they are two).
 *
 * `spellStats` comes back beside the snapshots because the LEARNER is the subject of some of these
 * tests and the snapshot only reports the SELF caster's rounded columns.
