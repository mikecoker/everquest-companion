# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# API Gateway HTTP API — one route, auth NONE, throttled twice (§8.1, §9.1).
#
# STAGE CHOICE, and a deliberate deviation from the plan's naming table. The plan
# says "stage v1" AND "route POST /v1/feedback" AND an api_url of
# `https://<id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/v1/feedback`. Those three
# cannot all be true: a NAMED stage prefixes every path, so stage `v1` + route
# `/v1/feedback` resolves at `/v1/v1/feedback`. We keep the VERSION IN THE PATH
# (which is what "versioned from day one" means, and what lets a future web route
# join this API under its own version) and use the $default stage, so the
# committed FEEDBACK_API_URL is exactly the URL the plan writes down.
#
# NO CORS BLOCK. Every caller is the Electron main process — a non-browser client
# that sends no Origin and asks for no preflight. Adding CORS would only make the
# endpoint reachable from web pages, which is strictly more attack surface for a
# capability nothing needs.
