/**
 * POST /v1/feedback — the ENTIRE public surface of this product's cloud (§8).
 *
 * ONE VALIDATOR, CLIENT AND SERVER. `validateSubmit` is imported from
 * src/shared/feedback.ts — the same pure function the dialog runs before it
 * enables Send and the main process runs before it opens a socket. That is the
 * whole reason this handler is TypeScript in this repo instead of a hand-written
 * bundle in a second one: a change to the request shape is ONE commit that moves
 * the contract, the client and the server together. infra/build.mjs bundles it
 * with esbuild; nothing here is transpiled by hand.
 *
 * THE STORE IS AURORA DSQL (serverless postgres). The step order below is
 * unchanged from the DynamoDB version — it was never about DynamoDB, it was
 * about stopping as early as possible — but every step is now one SQL statement
 * instead of one item operation, and connection/retry/retention live in ./db.ts.
 *
 * STEPS ARE ORDERED CHEAPEST FIRST, and every one of them is a place to stop
 * before touching state:
 *
 *   1. size          -> 413 too_large        (before JSON.parse)
 *   1.5 NUL byte     -> 400 invalid_payload  (also before JSON.parse)
 *   2. shape         -> 400 invalid_payload  (the shared validator; {field})
 *   3. config+profile+idempotency, ONE round trip
 *        kill switch -> 503 closed           (message rendered verbatim)
 *        blocked     -> 403 blocked          (client stops retrying)
 *        replay      -> 200 + original reportId, upload: null
 *   4. quota         -> 429 quota_exceeded   (guarded UPSERT, {retryAfterSec})
 *   5. mint ULID + spam score (SCORED, NEVER REJECTED — §9.5)
 *   6. ONE TRANSACTION: report + idempotency row (they cannot fork)
 *   7. presigned POST, pinned to one key / 2 MB / 5 min / AES256
 *   8. 201
 *
 * WHAT THIS HANDLER CANNOT DO, by GRANT (§8.5): read the corpus, update or
 * delete a report, list the bucket. It logs in as the `feedback_ingest` database
 * role, which holds INSERT on `report` and nothing else. It creates and it
 * counts. A full compromise leaks nothing and destroys nothing.
 *
 * The client is never told anything about internals: a thrown error is logged
 * and answered with a flat 500 `internal`.

 * Step 4: consume one unit of the per-install daily quota. Returns false when

 *
 * WHY THE CAP CANNOT BE EXCEEDED under DSQL's fixed Repeatable Read + optimistic
 * concurrency. Two submits from one install on one day can race in exactly two
 * ways, and neither of them over-counts:
 *
 *   1. THEY SERIALIZE. The second transaction's snapshot already contains the
 *      first's increment, so `install_quota.n < :max` is evaluated against the
 *      real current count. At the cap the DO UPDATE's WHERE is false, no row is
 *      returned, and the request is refused. This is the ordinary path.
 *   2. THEY CONFLICT. Both read the same row from the same snapshot; DSQL takes
 *      no locks, detects the write-write conflict AT COMMIT, and aborts one with
 *      SQLSTATE 40001. The loser never committed, so nothing was double-counted
 *      and nothing was lost.
 *
 * There is no third case. What case 2 costs is a spurious 500 for a user who did
 * nothing wrong, which is why this runs inside `withRetry` — THE RETRY IS FOR THE
 * CALLER'S SAKE, NOT FOR THE CAP'S. On retry the racer lands in case 1 and gets
 * the honest answer. The INSERT arm is covered by the same reasoning through the
 * primary key: two first-of-the-day submits cannot both insert.
