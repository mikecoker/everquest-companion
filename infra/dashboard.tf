# The CloudWatch dashboard — surface 2 of the four in docs/plans/usage-analytics.md §1:
# "active sessions now, events/min, ingest 4xx/5xx, per-funnel-step counters
# today. The 'is anyone using it right now' glance."
#
# WHY A DASHBOARD AND NOT JUST THE TRIAGE TAB. The triage panel reads DSQL, and
# DSQL holds DAILY aggregates — it can tell you what yesterday looked like and it
# can tell you today's running totals, but it cannot tell you what is happening
# in the last five minutes, because nothing writes a five-minute row. The EMF
# documents the handler emits (infra/lambda/emf.ts) are exactly that missing
# resolution, and this is where they are read.
#
# EVERY WIDGET READS METRICS THE HANDLER ACTUALLY EMITS. `EQCompanion/Telemetry`
# is `EMF_NAMESPACE`; the metric names are the ones in `emitMetrics`. A widget
# naming a metric nothing publishes renders as an empty chart with no error,
# which is the failure mode to watch for when editing this file.
#
# NO ANALYTICS ID IS A DIMENSION ANYWHERE, here or in the emitter. A dimension
# value mints a billed metric and would rebuild — in the metrics store — the
# per-user trail T6 exists to not keep.
