# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IAM — two roles, both spelled out action by action (§8.5, §10.1).
#
# THE INGEST ROLE CAN CREATE AND COUNT. IT CANNOT READ THE BACKLOG OR DELETE A
# REPORT. Under DynamoDB that sentence was enforced HERE, by omitting Query,
# Scan and DeleteItem. Aurora DSQL has exactly one IAM action for data access —
# "may this principal open a connection" — so the property moves DOWN a layer:
#
#   * this role gets `dsql:DbConnect`, NOT `dsql:DbConnectAdmin`, so it can only
#     log in as a NAMED DATABASE ROLE that an admin has mapped to it;
#   * `infra/schema.sql` creates that role (`feedback_ingest`), maps it with
#     `AWS IAM GRANT`, and grants it INSERT on `report` and nothing else — no
#     SELECT, no UPDATE, no DELETE on the backlog.
#
# So the guarantee is intact and the check moved from "read the actions list" to
# "read the GRANT list". `dsql:DbConnectAdmin` on this role would have silently
# handed the public write endpoint superuser on the whole corpus; it is the one
# thing this file must never do.
#
# A presign still cannot grant what the signer lacks, so the 2 MB / one-key /
# 5-minute upload policy remains the ceiling of what a compromised handler could
# do to the bucket.
#
# The TRIAGE role is the dev machine's read/write path and DOES connect as
# `admin`: it runs the schema migration (CREATE TABLE / CREATE ROLE / GRANT) and
# it is the deletion path for `forget` and `wipe`. It exists so the triage CLI
# runs under a named role instead of raw account admin, and so the same script
# works unchanged from a second machine.
