// WHAT A SPELL IS WORTH, READ OFF THE WIKI'S OWN EFFECT LINES (JOS-391).
//
// `spellEffectClass.ts` classifies an effect line and deliberately reads no MAGNITUDES — its
// header says so, and says why: nobody had asked for them and inventing a taxonomy nobody has
// checked is how the name-stem era shipped four defects. Somebody has now asked. The Leveling
// tab's "New at this level" rows are a buying decision ("is this nuke worth the 99 mana"), and
// the only honest input to it is the number the page prints.
//
// So this is the magnitude reader, and it is a SEPARATE, DELETABLE layer for the same reason the
// classifier is: `spells.json` records what the wiki said, and everything derived from it lives
// where it can be deleted without taking the scrape with it. Pure over its arguments, no Electron -
// main computes it once at fold time (src/main/data/levelUnlocks.ts) and the numbers cross IPC
// while the effect strings stay behind. Its ONE import is `shared/spellScale.ts` (JOS-447), which
// is the same kind of layer one level further out: the mote-rank arithmetic, fitted to the owner's
// log, importing nothing itself.
//
// ── WHAT THESE NUMBERS ARE, AND WHAT THEY ARE NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// They are the spell's BASE figures at a stated level: no critical hits, no focus items, no AA
// multipliers, no spell-damage bonus, no resist. They are DIRECTIONAL - the right instrument for
// comparing two spells you are choosing between, not a damage meter.
//
// AND THE PER-SECOND FIGURES ARE SUSTAINED ONES SINCE JOS-444, BECAUSE RECAST IS IN THE CATALOG NOW.
// This header used to say the opposite - "RECAST IS NOT IN THE CATALOG AT ALL" - and it was true
// until 2026-08-22, when the scrape began capturing the wiki's `recast_time` (spells.json schema 3,
// `SpellEntry.recastMs`, 1,925 of 2,006 rows) and the client's own row grew a reader for the same
// number (spellsUsParse.ts field 10). So `dps`/`hps` divide by the CASTING CYCLE rather than by the
// cast alone: cast plus recast for an instant spell, cast plus the whole duration for an over-time
// one, and never a window shorter than cast plus recast.
//
// THE RE-USE TIMER STARTS WHEN THE CAST COMPLETES, which is the edge worth stating out loud: a
// recast SHORTER than the cast still lengthens the cycle. Garrison's Mighty Mana Shock is a 3.0s
// cast with a 1.5s recast and its sustained window is 4.5s, not 3.0s - 333 damage at L35 reads
// 74 dps where it used to read 111. What contributes nothing extra is a recast shorter than an
// OVER-TIME spell's own duration: those figures total the whole duration's ticks, so the window
// has to cover the duration, and a faster re-use timer cannot make the same ticks arrive sooner.
// A spell no source states a recast for is unchanged, figure for figure.
//
// The remaining caveats stay out of the UI on purpose: the caveat diet (AGENTS.md) - the panel says
// one quiet `directional` and stops.
//
// ── THE SHAPES, MEASURED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 664 hitpoint lines over the committed catalog in 51 distinct shapes. Every one of them is one
// of: a constant, a LEVEL RAMP stated as breakpoints, a RANGE stated as two bounds, or one of
// those marked per-tick. `tests/spellMetrics.test.mts` pins the nine the ticket named plus the
// exclusions below.
//
// WHAT IS EXCLUDED, AND WHY EACH EXCLUSION IS EVIDENCE-BACKED:
//
//   * `Increase Max Hitpoints by 202 (L34) to 225 (L42)` - a MAX-HP BUFF is not a heal. The head
//     test refuses it because `Max` sits between the verb and the noun (39 rows, plus 12 more
//     spelled `Max HP` / `Max Hit Points`).
//   * `Decrease HP when cast by 50` (67 rows) and `Increase HP when cast by ...` (42) - the
//     abbreviated spelling, and it is a DUPLICATE RENDERING rather than a second effect:
//     `Armor of Protection` states `Increase Max Hitpoints by 202 (L34) to 225 (L42)` and
//     `Increase HP when cast by 202 (L34) to 225 (L42)`, the same numbers twice. Reading both
//     would double every figure it touches, so this reader answers to the `Hit Points` spelling
//     only and says so here rather than guessing which of a pair is the real one.
//   * `Stacking: Block new spell if slot 3 is effect 'Max Hitpoints' and < 1100` and
//     `UNKNOWN CALC 118 base 406 max 446 attrib Max Hitpoints` - neither is an effect magnitude;
//     both fail the head test for free.

// ── AND WHERE THE WIKI'S SLOT TABLE IS SIMPLY MISSING A LINE (JOS-396) ─────────────────────────
//
// Odium's page lists one effect — `Increase Curse Counter by 8` — and no hitpoint line at all, so
// the reader above correctly answers "no figures" and the owner correctly reported a shaman nuke
// showing no damage. The number is not missing from the GAME, only from the page: the client's own
// `spells_us.txt` carries `2|0|-217|0|103|325` on spell 4093, which is 217 plus twice the caster's
// level, capped at 325, every tick for five ticks.
//
// So there is a SECOND source, and it is strictly a FALLBACK: the wiki's lines win wherever they
// exist, because they carry the level range the way the wiki states it and because they are the
// source every existing figure in the app was computed from. The client is consulted only for a
// spell whose wiki lines yield nothing. Fifteen spells in the committed catalog change; every other
// figure is byte-identical.
//
// THE SLOTS ARE READ IN THE CLIENT'S UNITS, WHICH ARE NOT THE WIKI'S:
//
//   * a magnitude is `|base| + step x level`, capped at `|max|` when max is non-zero. `calc` names
//     the step (see `CALC_STEPS`) and the SIGN OF `base` says which side it lands on. Reading
//     `base + 2L` literally off a negative base would give Odium 131 rather than 303.
//   * a slot lands EVERY TICK when the spell has a duration formula at all, and the tick count is
//     the CLIENT'S (`clientDurationTicks`), never the wiki's `durationMs`. One source states the
//     slot and the same source states how long it runs; crossing them would let a page's duration
//     multiply a magnitude the page does not know about.
//   * a permanent duration (formula 50/51) is a RATE WITH NO LENGTH and therefore contributes
//     NOTHING, exactly as `foldLine` already refuses a wiki per-tick line with no duration. This is
//     what keeps Lich, Call of Bones, Dark Pact and the nine other shapeshift self-buffs — whose
//     effect-0 slot is a permanent per-tick drain — from printing a total nobody can state.

 * It folds through the SAME `foldLine`/`assemble` the wiki path uses, so a client-sourced row and a
 * wiki-sourced one beside it are the same arithmetic and the same rounding rather than two
 * derivations that agree today. The only two differences are stated in the file header: the
 * magnitude comes from `|base| + step x level` capped at `|max|`, and the tick count comes from the
 * CLIENT'S duration rather than the page's.
 *
 * LIFETAPS ARE DAMAGE-ONLY HERE TOO, but by a different route. The wiki path DROPS a lifetap's
 * increase line because the page states the transfer twice, once from each end; the client states
 * it ONCE, so dropping it would throw away the only statement there is. An effect-0 slot on a
 * `Lifetap` spell is therefore counted as damage whatever its sign — `Soul Bond` is the one spell
 * in the catalog this decides.
