// shared/perf.ts — THE PURE HALF of performance profiling (docs/plans/perf-profiling.md).
//
// Everything here is arithmetic and vocabulary: the sample shape main pushes, the startup
// phase enum and its accounting, the lag thresholds, and the formatters the chip renders. No
// Electron, no Node, no React — so `tests/perf.test.mts` pins every rule that decides what a
// number MEANS, and main/renderer are left with wiring.
//
// It is a ZERO-IMPORT module for the same reason `shared/telemetry.ts` is one: `storeMigrations.ts`
// runs from store.ts's module scope, before electron-store exists, and needs the prefs
// normalizer without dragging the LogEvent union in behind it.
//
// TWO PROBES, TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS (plan P2). CPU% answers "is the app busy"; event-loop lag
// answers "is the app BLOCKED". They are not the same fact and the difference is the whole point
// of the feature: high lag with low app CPU says the MACHINE is loaded, not this app — which is
// what lets the app exonerate itself instead of being blamed for someone else's build.
