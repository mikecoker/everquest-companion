// spellLines.ts — the PURE spell-LINE model behind alert levelling intelligence.
//
// WHAT A "LINE" IS. EQ Legends re-tiers the classic spells as ROMAN-NUMERAL RANKS of one
// base name: the log casts `Mesmerization III`, `Allure VI`, `Lay on Hands X`, `Clarity III`.
// A LINE is therefore exactly the repo's existing rank-fold — `spellCanonKey` (parseCommon.ts)
// — and a RANK is the suffix that fold strips. This module is the one place that keeps the
// suffix instead of discarding it.
//
// TWO SOURCES, AND THEY DISAGREE — say so rather than average them:
//   * the LOG is authoritative for WHICH RANKS EXIST and which you have cast. It prints
//     `You begin casting Mesmerization III.` / `<mob> resisted your Mesmerization III!`.
//   * the committed spell DB (spells.json, scraped from the classic-EQ wiki) is authoritative
//     for the CLASS + LEVEL of a line, and for nothing else here: it holds `Mesmerization`
//     (Enchanter 16) with NO per-rank rows at all. Only 42 of its 1,926 spells form a
//     multi-entry rank line (Rune I–V, Yaulp I–IV, Clarity I–II, the poisons, the AA
//     passives), so the DB CANNOT say what level `Mesmerization III` is.
//   ⇒ a level shown next to a rank is the LINE's level ("Enchanter learns this line at 16"),
//     never the rank's. Callers must label it that way; this module never invents a per-rank
//     level, and `spellLineLevel` returns null rather than guess.
//
// RANK RECENCY. "Which rank am I actually using" is answered by observation, not by the DB:
// the alerts module records the newest ts per rank-preserving DISPLAY name (AlertsSnap
// `spellLastCast`), and `preferredRank` / `rankRecencyOrder` rank a line by it — most recently
// cast first. A rank never cast is never preferred and never offered as an upgrade.
//
// Lives in shared/ so the renderer (suggestions surface, upgrade strip) and any future
// main-side caller compile against ONE implementation; it imports nothing but types.

// is an OFFER: nothing is ever rewritten without a click (AGENTS.md "state, never process";
// world-model law 1).
//
// RANK-SENSITIVE ON PURPOSE, AND IT IS THE LAST PLACE THAT IS (JOS-276 sweep). The owner's law —
// "we should not use spell ranks for anything in the alert system - it should be compatible with
// any rank" — is about whether an alert FIRES, and nothing below decides that: since JOS-259 a
// literal spell matcher already covers every rank of its line, so a def here never goes stale and
// an offer never has to rescue one. What survives is the convenience it always also was: a chip
// that names the rank you just started casting, for a user who wants an alert whose NAME says
// "Mesmerization IV". `rankedDefs` therefore still reads the suffix, and reading it is the feature.
// The offer's own dedupe folds, though — see `suggestionCoverageId` in the wizard.
//
// TWO ACTIONS, and ADD-ALONGSIDE IS THE DEFAULT (owner decision). EQ Legends' loadout system
// means you can be a level-50 Paladin in one trio and a low-level Paladin in another; a swap
// puts you back on the old rank, so REPLACING the alert would silently mute it in the other
// loadout. Keeping both defs is the honest default; Replace is the deliberate "I've abandoned
// that rank" action. Both preserve the user's sound, volume and cooldown choices — the same
// respect-the-user semantics as `migrateAlertSounds` in main/data/defaultPacks.ts.
