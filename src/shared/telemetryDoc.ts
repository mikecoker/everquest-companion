// TELEMETRY.md, GENERATED FROM THE SCHEMA — plan decision T4.
//
// "`TELEMETRY.md` committed in the repo enumerates every event/field/bucket, generated from the
// schema so it cannot drift (a test pins schema↔doc parity)."
//
// That is the whole reason this module exists rather than a hand-written markdown file. The
// enum members, the bucket edges and the funnel steps below are READ OUT OF `shared/telemetry.ts`
// at render time — they are never retyped here — so a schema change that is not reflected in the
// committed doc fails `tests/telemetryDoc.test.mts`, and the fix is `npm run gen:telemetry-doc`,
// never an edit to the markdown.
//
// The only hand-written content here is PROSE: what each event is for, and the promises at the
// top and bottom of the page. Prose cannot drift from the schema because it makes no claims the
// schema could contradict — every claim that could is rendered from the tables.
//
// The rows are also the completeness check: `TELEMETRY_DOC_EVENTS` must cover
// `TELEMETRY_EVENT_KINDS` exactly, which is what makes "adding an event means adding a doc row"
// a test failure rather than a good intention.
//
// THE EVENT TABLE ITSELF LIVES IN `./telemetryDocEvents.ts` — split out when JOS-100's
// `errorReport` row pushed this file past the repo's 400-code-line ceiling, and re-exported
// below so the generator and the parity test import exactly what they always did. What stays
// here is the RENDERING and the bucket tables.
