// LEVEL UNLOCKS — "what's new at this level", as a wire shape and a pure join
// (docs/plans/levelup-whats-new.md § 1–2, wave O2).
//
// TWO SOURCES, ALREADY COMMITTED, NEITHER OF THEM SCRAPED HERE:
//   * spells.json's `classes` field states, per spell, WHICH CLASS gets it AT WHICH LEVEL —
//     parsed by shared/spellLevels.ts (2,001 pairs over the committed DB, measured wave O1).
//   * classes.json's `skillUnlocks` / `discUnlocks` state the same for skills, disciplines and
//     the three structure-derived innates (450 + 33 rows, measured wave O1).
// Main folds both into `LevelUnlockData` (src/main/data/levelUnlocks.ts) because both JSONs are
// bundled into the MAIN process; this file holds the shape they cross the wire in and every
// derivation the renderer performs on them, so `npm test` pins the arithmetic with no Electron.
//
// LAW 10 IS THE WHOLE DESIGN OF `comboClassesAt`. A level-up is a timestamped record and the
// class combo is a set of FUZZY, RETROACTIVELY REVISABLE intervals, so "which classes did that
// ding unlock things for" is a TIME JOIN at read (`comboAt`), never a stamped field. A ding
// toasted an hour ago re-counts correctly the moment a `/who` line or a user correction re-labels
// that span — there is nothing to reconcile because nothing was stamped.
//
// AND LAW 1: an unresolved loadout is never guessed. A slot holding {CLR,PAL} contributes BOTH
// classes to the count and the whole answer is labeled `ambiguous`; a slot with no evidence at
// all (all 16 candidates) contributes NOTHING — unioning sixteen classes would produce a number
// that is not about this character at all.
//
// Pure, dependency-free, RELATIVE value imports (the mobSearch.ts precedent).
