// ============================================================================
// outputs/baseline.ts — WHEN a dump was generated, and WHAT it covered. RECORDED, NOT A RESET.
// ============================================================================
//
// JOS-128 built this file to answer "since when", because that ticket made a dump load the
// BASELINE: it reset the model to exactly what the dump said and let log-derived loot accumulate
// from the generation instant forward.
//
// JOS-141 TOOK THE RESET BACK, and it is the owner's explicit ruling after field-testing Plane of
// Sky on 2026-08-09. A dump only covers WHAT WAS OPEN WHEN IT WAS GENERATED — the bank only if the
// bank window was up, the hoard likewise — and the file never says which. So resetting to the dump
// deleted banked Sky items the player still owned, every reload, which is a worse and quieter
// failure than the one JOS-128 set out to fix. The combination rule is FULLY ADDITIVE again
// (features/inventory/reconcile.ts owns it): the log accumulates, a dump only ever applies ON TOP,
// and nothing a reload does can lower a count. The accepted cost is stated there, not hidden.
//
// SO WHAT IS THIS FILE FOR NOW? Everything except the reset. The generation instant and the
// coverage set are still RECORDED on `ProgressState.inventorySource` and still worth knowing: they
// are what a freshness line reads, what a storage-scoped rule would need if the owner ever revives
// one, and the honest answer to "how old is this dump". What is GONE is the `isSinceBaseline`
// predicate and every windowed fold that consumed it — an instant nobody compares against is not a
// reset. Still pure (no fs, no Electron), so tests/inventoryBaseline.test.mts drives it under
// plain node.
//
// WHERE THE GENERATION INSTANT COMES FROM — two sources, measured, in this order:
//
//   1. THE LOG, and it is the authoritative one. EQ prints `Outputfile Complete: <file>` when
//      the dump finishes writing; the parser claims it as an `outputFile` event
//      (parseSession.ts). Its timestamp is EQ's own, parsed by the same `parseTs` that stamps
//      every loot row, so a baseline-versus-loot comparison happens inside ONE time base
//      instead of across two clocks. Matching is on the FILE NAME, because
//      `/outputfile inventory [optional filename]` lets the player choose it and the only
//      honest join is against the file we actually read.
//
//   2. THE FILE'S MTIME, as fallback — already carried end to end as `inventorySource.loadedAt`.
//      Measured on the owner's machine (2026-08-09) against the log line for the SAME dump:
//      mtime lands 767 ms after the log stamp, same second, same wall clock. Its failure modes
//      are stated rather than hidden, because a recorded instant that is wrong is silent:
//        * A dump COPIED between machines, restored from a backup, or touched by cloud sync
//          carries the copy time, so the recorded instant is too LATE.
//        * A hand-edited dump gets the same treatment.
//        * mtime is an OS wall clock; a loot `ts` is parsed from a log timestamp that carries
//          no zone, so a DST boundary can slide the two an hour apart in either direction.
//      Under JOS-141 none of these can cost the user an item, because nothing subtracts on the
//      strength of this instant any more. They are the reason it is reported WITH its source
//      (`generatedFrom`) rather than presented as a fact.
//
//   3. THE FILE'S CONTENT: there is no third source. The dump is a header row (Location, Name,
//      ID, Count, Slots), then rows, then the KeyRing table. It carries no date anywhere,
//      verified against the real 295-row dump.
//
// SECOND RESOLUTION. EQ log timestamps have one-second resolution, so both sources are floored to
// the second: an instant carried at higher precision than either clock has would be a false claim,
// and it lets the two sources land on the same number for the same dump (measured above).

// ----- WHAT the dump covers, AND WHY THE RESET HAD TO GO -----
//
// A dump is an instant AND a scope. The JOS-132 spike found that the inventory dump is an
// everything-dump only in principle: some storages are written only when the game happens to
// have them loaded (the depot when it has been opened, the hoard when its window is), and the
// file says nothing about the difference. So a storage absent from a dump is UNKNOWN, not
// empty, and a viewer that renders absence as "you have none there" is inventing an answer.
//
// THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT SANK THE RESET (JOS-141). A reset reads every absence as a zero, so a dump
// generated with the bank closed told the model the player's banked Sky items were gone. Coverage
// was recorded and could in principle have scoped the reset per storage; the owner was offered
// that and ruled against it, because a rule that resets some storages and not others still turns
// on a distinction the file never states. Additive needs no such distinction: a dump that says
// nothing about the bank simply adds nothing there.
//
// EVIDENCE IS THE ROW, NOT THE ITEM. A bank slot holding `Empty` still proves the bank was
// dumped; an item is not required and would be the wrong test (an empty bank is a real state
// this rule must be able to report). MEASURED against the owner's real dump (2026-08-09): it
// evidences equip, general, bank, sharedBank and keyRing, and carries NOT ONE
// `Personal-Depot<n>` row even though the parser has known that pattern since JOS-44 — which
// is the spike's claim, reproduced.
//
// UNCLASSIFIED BASE TOKENS ARE NOT COVERAGE. A storage whose token this build has never seen
// (the hoard is the open question) parses as `place.kind === 'unknown'`, and claiming coverage
// for a storage we cannot name would be worse than saying nothing. The awaiting-sample law
// applies: when a real dump shows the token, it graduates into `ContainerKind` and lands here
// through the total map below, with no change to this rule.
