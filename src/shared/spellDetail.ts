// spellDetail.ts — WHAT ONE SPELL IS, as the committed sources state it, and the PURE selection
// of which of those facts a card may draw (JOS-293).
//
// Two halves, both here so main (which builds the record), the preload bridge (which types it) and
// the renderer (which draws it) compile against ONE definition:
//
//   1. `SpellDetail` — the record main answers `spells:detail` with. Every field is OPTIONAL for a
//      reason: it mirrors `SpellEntry` (shared/buffTypes.ts), whose fields are absent exactly when
//      the wiki page omitted them. Nothing here is ever filled in with a default, a zero or a dash.
//   2. `spellStatRows` / `spellLineageLine` — the fact SELECTION. A row exists if and only if a
//      source stated the field behind it (world-model law 1). This is the half worth unit-testing,
//      which is why it is a pure function over the record rather than JSX inside the card.
//
// THE LINEAGE BOUNDARY IS PART OF THE MODEL, NOT AN OVERSIGHT (the DATA-FIRST half of JOS-293).
// A rank line is enumerated by the sources that NAME its ranks, and that is all it is:
//   * the committed spell DB carries 121 rank-suffixed rows across 72 lines (Rune I-V, Burnout
//     I-IV, the poison ladders, the AA passives). For the other ~1,800 spells it holds ONE row,
//     which is why `Celestial Remedy III` has no DB sibling to point at even though the game
//     plainly has one.
//   * the LOG names every rank you have actually cast (`AlertsSnap.spellLastCast`, which is
//     rank-preserving on purpose) — 36 distinct suffixed names in the owner's own log.
// So `members` is a list of ranks SOMEBODY NAMED, each labelled with who named it, and `replaces`
// is the highest of them below the one you are looking at. There is deliberately NO "rank 3 of 5":
// no source in this repo states how many ranks a line has, so a denominator would be invented.
// See the report on JOS-293 for the cross-line half (overwrite/stacking), which the committed data
// does not state at all.
