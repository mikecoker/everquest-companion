// ============================================================================
// feedbackPerf.ts — THE LAST TEN MINUTES, folded small enough to ride a bug report (JOS-369).
// ============================================================================
//
// "It hitches sometimes" is the report we get, and nothing in it says whether the MACHINE
// stalled, WE stalled, or the log READ stalled at that moment. JOS-367 built the two clocks and
// the ~10 minute rings (`main/livePerfProbe.ts`, `main/log/tailIoStats.ts`); this file is the
// fold that turns those rings into something a report can carry, and the one renderer the
// dialog, the triage CLI and the triage panel all print through.
//
// ============================ WHY UN-BUCKETED HERE, BUCKETED ON THE HEARTBEAT ============
// THE COMMENT LAW THE TICKET ASKS FOR, stated once, here, because the two paths look
// contradictory until you name what makes them different: CONSENT AND AUDIENCE.
//
//   * The HEARTBEAT (`telemetry/liveFacts.ts`) leaves the machine ON ITS OWN, for every install
//     with the switch on, and it describes a FLEET. Raw milliseconds there would be a per-install
//     fingerprint nobody asked to hand over and a resolution no fleet question needs, so it ships
//     BUCKET INDICES off a closed ladder (`LIVE_STALL_MS_EDGES`) — the telemetry bright line.
//   * A FEEDBACK REPORT is USER-INITIATED, shown in full before it is sent, and describes ONE
//     MOMENT the user is complaining about. Bucketing that would destroy the only thing it is
//     for: the SHAPE of the hitch — where in the ten minutes it happened, how wide it was, and
//     whether the tail was reading at the time. So this block is raw whole milliseconds.
//
// Neither posture is a relaxation of the other. Nothing here auto-sends, and nothing here is
// gathered unless a report is being composed.
//
// WHAT IS AND IS NOT IN IT. Whole numbers and members of closed enums declared in
// `shared/telemetry.ts` — no strings from the machine, no paths, nothing from the log, no
// character or install identity. The block is machine TIMING, which is why it is shown in the
// preview but is not behind its own checkbox: there is no personal data in it to consent to.
//
// PURE. It is imported by `shared/feedback.ts`, which the ingest Lambda bundles, so it may never
// reach Electron, the DOM or `node:`.
