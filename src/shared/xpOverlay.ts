// xpOverlay.ts — WHAT THE XP OVERLAY IS ALLOWED TO SHOW, and the one derivation it owns (JOS-195).
//
// The overlay's numbers are not new: the pace comes from `rangeStats`, the projection from
// `levelEta`, the AA read from `aaPace`, the drop rates from `lootRates.windowItemRows`, and the
// stretch they all cover from `timeslice`. Everything in this file is therefore either (a) the
// small amount of NEW knowledge — which items are motes, and which rows a user has switched off —
// or (b) a filter over an existing answer. Nothing here divides anything by anything.
//
// Pure: no React, no DOM, no Electron, no clock read. The one VALUE import is relative
// (`./lootRates`) — the repo-wide rule that lets tests/xpOverlay.test.mts import this straight
// under tsx.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE CONFIGURABILITY IS A ROW CHECKLIST AND NOTHING ELSE (owner scope, JOS-195). There is no
// widget builder here and no per-row arithmetic option: a user may hide a row they do not read,
// and that is the whole of it. So the persisted shape is a LIST OF IDS from a closed union, it is
// rebuilt field by field on the way into the store (`normalizeXpRows`), and ABSENT means "all of
// them" rather than "none" — a store written before this shipped must not come back empty.

/**
 * The rows this window can draw, in the order it draws them.
 *
 *   'xp'    — the progress rate(s). ONE ROW PER MEASURE THE LOG IS STATING (JOS-202), like the
 *             motes entry below: levels of progress per hour while the game still states a level-bar
 *             percentage, AND AA per hour ALWAYS — AAs are earned below the cap in this game, the
 *             two bars fill at the same time, and a slice with no completion reads a measured 0.00
 *             rather than dropping the row out from under someone watching a rate. At the cap only
 *             the AA row survives (JOS-36/11; shared/aaPace.ts states why those are two different
 *             measurements).
 *   'eta'   — what is next: time to the level, or (at cap) the inferred wait for the next AA.
 *   'motes' — motes per hour, one line per mote type seen in the slice.
 *
 * SO A CHECKLIST ENTRY IS NOT A ROW COUNT. `XpRowId` is what a user switches off; how many lines
 * that draws is the window's business (`overlay/xpRows.ts`), and it changes with what the log has
 * said. That is why the persisted union could stay closed and unchanged through JOS-202: a stored
 * ['xp','eta'] from a build before it still means "the pace and what is next", and picks up the AA
 * row without the user re-visiting the checklist.
 *
 * A CLOSED UNION, because it is persisted: a stored id this build does not know is dropped rather
 * than rendered, and a future row cannot be turned on by a hand-edited store.
