// profiles.ts — TWO distinct "profile" concepts live here. Read this header first.
//
//  1. GameProfile      — a SERVER / RULESET (EverQuest Legends, Project 1999). Chooses
//                        which quest data is bundled and which log ruleset parses lines.
//                        Load-bearing today (log/parser.ts, log/rulesets.ts, data/index.ts).
//  2. Share profiles   — the USER-FACING settings/sharing model (Task: profiles): export
//                        your settings, import someone else's, share individual alerts as a
//                        paste-safe string. Everything below the divider.
//
// They are unrelated; the file keeps both only because `profiles` is the natural name for
// each. Nothing here may import Node built-ins — the renderer bundles this module.

/**
 * A "game profile" identifies a server / ruleset. Different EverQuest versions
 * and emulators have wildly different quest rules, item stats, and even log
 * formats, so the app is built around swappable profiles:
 *   - quest data is scraped per profile and bundled under data/<id>/
 *   - log parsing uses a per-profile ruleset (see main/log/rulesets.ts)
 * Adding a new server later (e.g. Project 1999) means adding a profile here, a
 * scraper source (scripts/sources/<id>.ts), and a log ruleset.

// ===========================================================================================
//
// GOALS (user's words, restated as invariants)
//   * export your settings; import settings from other users
//   * settings are GLOBAL — not linked to a character
//   * alerts are INDIVIDUALLY copyable, and "all my alerts" is one string too
//   * imports are ADDITIVE — an import NEVER deletes or replaces what you already have
//   * the envelope must survive into a future where a character's progress (level/AA,
//     inventory, raid kills, Sky quests) rides the same pipe, and a web backend serves it
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------ classification
//
// Every piece of persisted state is exactly one of four classes. Only GLOBAL is exportable,
// and it is exported through an explicit WHITELIST (shareSchema.ts) — a new setting is
// PRIVATE BY DEFAULT and cannot leak by being added to the store.
//
//   GLOBAL     portable between users, carries no machine paths and no character identity.
//              alerts[] · alertPrefs · overlays.<kind>.{bgAlpha} · the whitelisted
//              renderer UI prefs (combat scope, boss density, posky class filter + count
//              source, item favorites, game profile).
//
//   CHARACTER  tied to one character (and to its epoch — AGENTS.md "character epochs").
//              byCharacter[<name_server>] (inventory counts, completedQuests). NOT in the
//              settings bundle: a settings import must never touch another player's
//              progress, and "which character" is meaningless on the receiving machine.
//              This is the slot the FUTURE character-profile envelope fills (design below).
//
//   MACHINE    paths, window geometry, install/update bookkeeping — meaningless or actively
//              harmful on another machine. eqInstallDir · activeLogPath · windowBounds ·
//              inventorySource.path · updateChannel · alertSoundMigration ·
//              overlays.<kind>.{open,locked,bounds,drill} · localStorage 'eq.view'
//              (last open tab) · <userData>/soundpacks/ (binary assets; referenced by id
//              and re-installed from the registry instead) · errors.log.
//              EXCLUDED BY CONSTRUCTION — see the whitelist note above. A path can never
//              appear in an export because no exporter ever reads one.
//
//   DERIVED    rebuildable from the log or the network; exporting it would ship stale data
//              and (for the mined overlay) another user's play history.
//              <userData>/message-overlay.json (learned spell-message verdicts) ·
//              item-knowledge-cache.json · registry-cache.json · every module snapshot
//              (loot/kills/leveling/combat) — those come from replaying the log.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------ the envelope
//
// One envelope for every shareable thing, so the alert-sharing feature and the future
// character/backend features are the same code path:
//
//   EQC1-<base64url(deflateRaw(utf8(canonicalJson(envelope))))>
//
//   envelope = { v, kind, app, at, sum, body }
//     v    schema version (SHARE_SCHEMA_VERSION). A decoder REFUSES v > its own and
//          explains why ("made by a newer version"); older v are migrated forward.
//     kind discriminates the body ('alerts' | 'settings' | future 'character').
//     app  the app version that produced it — provenance for bug reports, never trusted.
//     at   ISO creation timestamp.
//     sum  checksum of canonicalJson(body) (NOT of the envelope, so re-wrapping the same
//          body — e.g. a backend re-serving it — keeps the same sum).
//     body the payload.
//
// Why this shape:
//   - compress+base64url ⇒ ONE line, no `+/=` to mangle in Discord/chat/URLs; ~5-8x on
//     JSON, so "all my alerts" stays comfortably under Discord's 2000-char message limit.
//   - the `EQC1-` prefix is the human tell ("this is an EQ Companion share string") AND
//     the version tripwire: a future incompatible format becomes `EQC2-` and old clients
//     reject it by prefix before spending a byte on inflate.
//   - checksum-before-apply ⇒ a truncated paste is REPORTED, never half-applied.
//
// WHERE THE CODE LIVES. This file kept growing past the factoring ceiling, so the share
// model is now three modules and `shared/profiles` re-exports all of them — every consumer
// still imports from here, and nothing may import the split files directly:
//   ./shareSchema  the wire format: envelope, canonical JSON + checksum, body shapes, the
//                  export whitelist, and the untrusted-input sanitizers.
//   ./shareMerge   the apply semantics: the additive alert merge and the opt-in scalar diff.
//   this file      game profiles, the whitelisted BUILDERS, and the preview wire shapes.
// The codec (compression) lives in src/main/shareCodec.ts because it needs node:zlib;
// everything in the three shared modules is pure so it runs in the renderer, in main, and
// under node:test.

// MERGE. Character bodies are SNAPSHOTS, not settings — you don't "additively import"
// someone else's AA total into yours. They are therefore READ-ONLY on import: they open a
// viewer ("Vebarn@freeport — 12 raid targets, 4/12 Sky quests"), and the only additive
// action offered is per-row ("mark these Sky quests complete on MY character"), which routes
// through the existing per-character progress writes. The additive law holds because the
// import never writes a character record wholesale.
//
// BACKEND (later; explicitly not now). The natural split: the app POSTs the SAME envelope
// JSON (uncompressed — compression is a transport concern of the paste format only), the
// service stores it under an opaque share id and serves `GET /p/<id>` → envelope. The client
// validates `v`/`sum` exactly as it does for a pasted string, so a hostile or buggy service
// can't inject anything a paste couldn't. `EQC1-` strings and share URLs stay
// interchangeable; a URL is just a pointer to a body.
//
// PRIVACY (a design constraint, not a footnote). A settings bundle is anonymous by
// construction — the whitelist above admits no name, no server, no path. A CHARACTER profile
// is the opposite: name + server IS an identity on a live server, and inventory/kill history
// is a movement log. So the character envelope must be (a) opt-in per share, (b) explicit
// about what it includes with a per-section preview BEFORE the string/URL exists, (c)
// capable of a pseudonymous mode (drop `character.name`, keep class/level/progress), and
// (d) revocable once a backend exists (deleting the share id must actually stop serving it).
// None of that is required for the settings/alert sharing shipped today, which is exactly
// why the two kinds are separate `kind`s rather than one growing blob.
