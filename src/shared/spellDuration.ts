// HOW LONG THE WIKI SAYS A SPELL LASTS — the one reader of `SpellEntry.durationText` (JOS-189).
//
// It lived in `scripts/scrape-spells.ts` and was only ever run at SCRAPE time, which is why a form
// it could not read became a permanent null in the committed catalog. It is here now because two
// callers need the same answer and a second copy would drift:
//
//   * `scripts/scrape-spells.ts` fills `durationMs` when it writes the file, and
//   * `src/main/data/spellDb.ts` fills the ones a PREVIOUS scrape left null when it loads it.
//
// The second caller is the whole point and it is idempotent in both directions, the same property
// `spellCorrections.ts` is built around: a re-scrape through the fixed reader supplies the number
// itself and the load-time fill becomes a no-op, while today's committed file — scraped before the
// reader could read these forms — is understood without being hand-edited. `durationText` is the
// wiki's own text either way; nothing here invents a duration the wiki did not state.
//
// WHY IT MATTERS AT ALL. `BuffInstances.applyMessageBuff` returns early for a landing that states
// no duration, no illusion flag and no PERMANENCE (JOS-215's third arm — see `SpellStats.isPermanent`,
// which reads `durationText` rather than the number this file derives from it). So a spell whose
// duration string this file cannot read is a spell the buffs window can never draw — however correct
// its three messages are. A shaman reported exactly that for Spirit of the Puma, whose wiki duration
// is the three characters `60s`; 89 rows of the committed scrape were in that state.
//
// THE `Permanent` ARM IS NOT A GAP THIS FILE SHOULD CLOSE. `parseDurationMs` deliberately returns
// null for the word, because a permanent buff has no number — inventing one would put a countdown
// in front of a player for a buff that is never going to end. The model reads the WORD instead.

 * The wiki's CLOCK form, which carries no unit words at all: `H:MM:SS` or `M:SS`.
 *
 * WHY IT IS READ BY COUNTING COLONS, and why that is a reading rather than a guess. Three fields
 * are hours:minutes:seconds and two are minutes:seconds — the ordinary clock convention, and the
 * DB is its own witness for it: `Form of the Bear` states `2h 24m` while its two siblings
 * `Form of the Great Bear` and `Form of the Howler` state `2 hours 24 minutes`, and the 56 focus
 * rows state `2:24:00` for the same span. Read as H:MM:SS all three agree on 8,640,000 ms; read
 * any other way they contradict one another. `Laceration` (`0:00:24`) and `Promised Renewal`
 * (`0:00:12`) write the leading zero-hours field out in full, which is what fixes the three-field
 * reading, and the two-field one falls out of it.
 *
 * THE FIRST GROUP WINS. `2:24:00 (3:36:00)` states a base and a parenthesized extended figure; the
 * base is what the model wants, because `SpellStats.estimateFor` treats the DB number as a FLOOR an
 * observed cycle may raise and never as a ceiling — so taking the larger one would put a number in
 * front of the player that no cast of theirs can reach.
