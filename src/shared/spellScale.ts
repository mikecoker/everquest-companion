// spellScale.ts — what a spell's DAMAGE reads at a mote upgrade level (JOS-447).
//
// ============================================================================
// SOURCE: MEASURED, BECAUSE NOTHING PUBLISHES IT
// ============================================================================
// The gear engine could be ported (`itemUpgrade.ts` is the wiki's own ItemLevelSlider module, read
// line by line). No such source exists for spells: the wiki has no per-rank spell stats and no
// spell slider, and the client's `spells_us.txt` carries the CLASSIC rank lines (`Yaulp II`) rather
// than the Legends mote ranks, which are server side. So every number below was FITTED to the
// owner's own combat log (2.4M lines, eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt), and the fit is recorded as
// fixtures in `tests/spellScale.test.mts` so it can be re-argued rather than trusted.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE MEASUREMENT, AND WHY IT IS DONE ON RATIOS
// ============================================================================
// The log states the rank a cast used (`You begin casting Garrison's Mighty Mana Shock VIII.`; an
// unsuffixed cast line is the BASE) and it names the spell on every hit (`You hit X for 600 points
// of magic damage by Garrison's Mighty Mana Shock.`), marking criticals. Maximum non-critical hit
// per (spell, rank, level) is therefore the unresisted damage, sampled.
//
// IT IS NOT THE SPELL'S BASE FIGURE, THOUGH, and that is the whole difficulty: the owner's worn
// gear multiplies it. Measured on BASE-RANK casts against the client's own magnitude formula, the
// factor is 1.0 in some windows and ~1.2216 in others (Shock of Lightning, Lightning Bolt, Spirit
// Tap and base-rank Garrison's all read 1.219..1.222 of their computed base in the August windows;
// Chaos Flux and Anarchy read 1.017 in July). A worn multiplier this app models nowhere and the
// figures here deliberately exclude (spellMetrics.ts's header: no crits, focus, AA or resist).
//
// So the rank rule is read off RATIOS BETWEEN TWO RANKS OF ONE SPELL, where the worn factor
// cancels. The owner cast Garrison's at base on 2026-08-06 (levels 19..24) and at VIII on
// 2026-08-21 (the same levels, on a re-levelled loadout), with the same worn factor in both
// windows, which gives six independent same-level pairs:
//
//     level 19  337 -> 498      level 22  351 -> 519
//     level 20  342 -> 506      level 23  356 -> 526
//     level 21  346 -> 512      level 24  361 -> 534
//
// Every one of the six is `floor(base x 1.48)` EXACTLY, and none of them is the ceiling. 1.48 is
// `1 + 8 x 0.06`. A second spell agrees at a different rank: Discordant Mind reads 472 at base and
// 528 at II in windows whose worn factor is the same 1.2196, and 528/472 = 1.1186, which is
// `1 + 2 x 0.06` to within a point of rounding.
//
//     SIX PERCENT OF THE BASE AMOUNT PER RANK, AND THE SUM IS FLOORED.
//
// ============================================================================
// THIS IS NOT THE ITEM ENGINE'S DAMAGE RULE, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS MEASURED
// ============================================================================
// The ticket's hypothesis was that spells mirror `itemUpgrade.scaleDamage` — ten percent a rank,
// `base + floor(base * N / 10)` — which at rank VIII would make the owner's Garrison's 599 or 600
// against its base of 333. The log says otherwise, and says it twice:
//
//   * the six same-level pairs above put the rank-VIII multiplier at 1.4787 (interval
//     [1.47977, 1.48034) if the rounding is a floor), not 1.8. Ten percent a rank is outside that
//     interval by twenty standard widths.
//   * the 600 the owner reads in his log IS `floor(492 x 1.2216)` — the fitted 492 wearing the same
//     worn factor his base-rank casts wear. Take the factor out and the base figure is 492.
//
// A reader who compares this app's `dmg 492` against a 600 in his own log is seeing the caveat
// spellMetrics.ts has always stated, not a defect: these are the spell's own numbers with no gear
// in them. Ten percent would have printed 599 and agreed with the log by accident, on a spell whose
// worn factor happens to be 1.22.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT IS NOT SCALED IN V1, AND THE DIRECTION OF THE ERROR
// ============================================================================
// HEALING, MANA AND CAST TIME STAY AT BASE. The owner states that a levelled spell "casts faster,
// has better mana costs, and does more damage", and the log carries no mana or cast-time readings
// at all, so two of the three axes have no evidence to fit. Healing does: the same method over the
// owner's `You healed X for N hit points by <Spell>.` lines puts Slugs Healing at 204 / 222 / 228 /
// 235 / 241 for base / III / IV / V / VI and Superior Healing at 892 / 943 / 968 for II / IV / V,
// both of which are THREE percent a rank rather than six. That is a second rule for a second stat
// class and the ticket scopes v1 to damage, so it is recorded in the tests and not shipped.
// Consequence, stated once so no surface has to caveat it: for a spell above base rank, sustained
// dps UNDERSTATES slightly (the real cast is faster), damage-per-mana UNDERSTATES (the real mana is
// lower), and every healing figure is the base one.
