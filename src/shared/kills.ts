// THE KILL RECORD — per-mob kill history broken down PER INSTANCE TIER, the pure helpers
// that derive its convenience scalars, and the kills module's IPC shapes. Re-exported from
// types.ts (which sits at the 400-line factoring cap), so every existing
// `import type { KillInfo, KillMap } from '@shared/types'` keeps working unchanged.
//
// WHY PER TIER (2026-08-04, owner-verified misattribution). The record used to be five
// scalars — {count, bestTier, firstTs, lastTs, display} — and the fold took Math.max on BOTH
// the tier and the timestamp, so those two facts could come from DIFFERENT kills. The bosses
// view then grouped each target by the class-combo interval covering its `lastTs` while
// painting `bestTier`: Lord of Ire, killed at d4 on Aug 01 (a PAL/MNK/ENC loadout) and again
// at d0 on Aug 03 (ROG/PAL/BER), rendered a d4 badge filed under ROG/PAL/BER — a loadout that
// never killed it at d4. The combo-interval layer was right; the KILL RECORD was lossy.
//
// `tiers` is the TRUTH. The four scalars are DERIVED from it (`killTotals`) and kept only so
// consumers that legitimately want the whole-mob summary (mob page, loot sourcing, the
// new-defeat signal) keep working. One fold writes the tiers map; nothing writes a scalar by
// hand. See world-model law 10: the tier is a fact ABOUT a kill, so it lives with the kill —
// the combo interval, which is revisable, is still joined at read time and never stamped.

// NON-difficulties below. Before 2026-08-09 there were only the five, and key 0 carried three
// different worlds at once: a base-difficulty instance, the open world (which has no lockout of
// any kind), and a kill folded before the scan had seen any zone line at all. The owner clears
// d0 through d4 every week, so that conflation was not an edge case — it was the base rung of
// every weekly ladder, which the UI had to draw as an unfilled outline because the model could
// not commit to what it meant.
//
// The ZONE LINE can commit, and always could (`zoneTier`, main/log/parseWorld.ts): an instance
// entry carries a `- Solo`/`- Group N` suffix, an ordinal, or a difficulty adjective; the open
// world carries a bare zone name and nothing else. So the three worlds are now three different
// keys, and only the five difficulties are difficulties.

/**
 * The kill happened in the OPEN WORLD — a bare zone name, no instance of any kind.
 *
 * It is not d0 and it is not a lesser d0: the community wiki's instances-and-lockouts guide puts
 * the weekly lockout on a boss PER DIFFICULTY of its INSTANCE, and an open-world spawn has no

// the wrong key to look a mob up WITH, and every surface that wanted a count had spelled its own

//
//   · `WorldModel.label()`'s spawn-generation suffix — the Overview Target card names the mob you
//     just killed as "an elemental capturer (14)", and no record is ever keyed that way (the
//     suffix appears in NO log line — world-model law 2). THIS is the bug JOS-350 reports: the
//     Mobs tab, searching the catalog's suffix-free spelling, showed the real total while the
//     same mob opened from the combat-fed surface read 0.
//   · the three apostrophe glyphs — the log writes ``Innoruuk`s Chosen`` with a backtick, the
//     catalog and the wiki write it with `'` or `’`, so a catalog-spelled lookup missed a record
//     the log had been filing all along.
//
// So the join canonicalizes BOTH SIDES with `mobKey`: `killIndex` re-keys the map once (folding
// any two spellings that were one mob into one record), `killsFor` reads it. Same shape as
// bosses' `lowerKillMap` — re-key, don't re-implement — and it is the ONE join now, so the mob
// page cannot disagree with the row that opened it.
