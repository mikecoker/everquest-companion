// shared/graphicsPrefs.ts — THE PURE HALF of graphics compatibility (JOS-40).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A player on an RTX 5080 (driver 591.86, Windows 11) reported the floating
// overlays producing black-screen artifacting. The overlays are transparent, frameless,
// always-on-top windows — the one window shape whose correctness depends entirely on the
// driver's per-pixel alpha compositing — and there is no way to reproduce that here. So the app
// ships the two SELF-SERVE switches that between them retire both halves of the risk:
//
//   safeMode        — draw without the graphics card at all (`app.disableHardwareAcceleration()`).
//                     Whole-app, decided before Electron is ready, so it is a NEXT-LAUNCH setting
//                     by construction rather than by policy.
//   opaqueOverlays  — build the overlay windows WITHOUT transparency, on a solid background the
//                     same colour they already paint. Per-window, so it applies when an overlay
//                     is next opened.
//
// It is a ZERO-IMPORT module for the same reason `shared/perf.ts` and `shared/telemetry.ts` are:
// `storeMigrations.ts` runs from store.ts's module scope, before electron-store exists, and needs
// this normalizer without dragging the LogEvent union in behind it. No Electron, no Node — so
// `tests/graphicsPrefs.test.mts` pins every rule that decides what a switch MEANS.
//
// GENERIC ON PURPOSE — NO WINE DETECTION HERE. The env var below is the door a launcher script, a
// Wine prefix or a support reply can reach without the app's UI, which matters precisely in the
// case these switches exist for: a window you cannot see is a window whose Preferences you cannot
// open. Nothing in this module knows what a Wine prefix is, and nothing should.
//
// JOS-31 KEPT THAT PROMISE AND STILL AUTOMATED THE FALLBACK. The env door turned out not to be
// enough on its own: a user whose overlay is a stuck black box does not know there is a variable,
// and telling them to find one is a support reply we would have to write for every one of them.
// So this module grew a THIRD state per switch — `auto` — and a pure `resolveGraphics` that folds
// a stored preference together with what the RUNTIME recommends. What does the recommending is
// somebody else's problem (src/shared/wineDetect.ts decides, src/main/wine.ts wires it): this file
// takes a `GraphicsAuto` of two booleans and could not tell you where they came from. That is the
// same seam `envDisablesGpu` already drew, one level up.

/**
 * One switch's stored value. THREE states, because two cannot express the thing this ticket
 * needs: "leave it to the app" and "off, and I mean it" are different answers, and under a
 * detected Wine prefix they produce opposite windows.
 *
 *   'auto' — the default. The app decides from the environment it finds itself in (today: a Wine
 *            prefix turns OPAQUE OVERLAYS on and leaves safe mode off — JOS-352 inverted the
 *            second half, since safe mode is itself what blanks a window under Wine; everywhere
 *            else `auto` resolves to OFF).
 *   'on'   — the user asked for the compatibility path, wherever they are running.
 *   'off'  — the user REFUSED it, wherever they are running. This is the state that did not exist
 *            before, and without it detection would be a trap rather than a default: a Wine user
 *            who prefers see-through overlays could never get them back.
