// storePlans.ts — the two PLANNER DOCUMENTS' store accessors: exaltation sets (D4) and gear sets
// (JOS-286, phase 5).
//
// SPLIT OUT OF store.ts FOR FILE MASS, NOT FOR SCOPE — the roster.ts/windows.ts/perf.ts rule this
// repo already states in three places: `src/main/store.ts` sits at the measured 400-code-line
// ceiling, and the answer to that is a SPLIT rather than a widened threshold. Phase 5 needed one
// more read/write pair than that file had room for, and the two pairs belong together anyway:
// they are the same shape of promise over two per-character documents.
//
// WHAT MOVED IS CODE, NOT AUTHORITY. `setProgress` is still the one write path into `byCharacter`
// and it is imported from store.ts; both directions still run through the pure validators in
// ./planner/validate.ts, so "what a stored plan may contain" has exactly one definition and the
// round trip is a fixed point.
//
// NO SCHEMA BUMP AND NO MIGRATION FOR EITHER KEY, DELIBERATELY. `exaltPlans` and `gearSets` are
// ADDITIVE optional keys: nothing that already exists changes meaning, every reader defaults on a
// missing key, and electron-store rewrites the whole parsed object so the key survives a round
// trip through an older build. The store-migration law asks for a step when a persisted shape
// CHANGES; adding a key every reader already defaults is the case it explicitly does not cover.
// `tests/plannerStore.test.mts` and `tests/gearSetStore.test.mts` pin both halves of both.
//
// Per character, like every other key on `ProgressState`: a plan is built for one character's
// loadout. Whole-array writes — a list is small (tens of entries at most) and the renderer edits
// it as one document.
