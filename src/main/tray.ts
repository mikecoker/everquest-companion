// ============================================================================
// tray.ts — the notification-area icon, and what the X on the main window means (JOS-139).
// ============================================================================
//
// THE FEATURE IN ONE SENTENCE: closing the main window HIDES it and the companion keeps running —
// the log watcher, the timers, the alerts, the voice, the presence watcher and every open overlay
// carry on exactly as they were — and a tray icon is how you get the window back.
//
// WHAT LIVES HERE, and why it is one file:
//   * the `Tray` itself: the icon, the tooltip, the context menu, the left-click restore;
//   * the QUITTING LATCH, so every real quit still ends the process;
//   * the close INTERCEPTOR that windows.ts calls from the main window's own `close` handler; and
//   * the POPOVER — the card that appears above the icon the first time a close hides the window.
// They are one file because they are one behaviour: an icon with no interceptor is decoration, an
// interceptor with no icon is a lost app, and the popover exists only to explain the first time
// the two of them act.
//
// THE POLICY IS NOT HERE. `shared/closeToTray.ts` holds the decision (`closeIntent`), the notice
// rule (`shouldShowTrayNotice`) and the card's placement geometry (`trayNoticeBounds`), all pure
// and node-tested. This file supplies the three facts they need — the stored preference, whether
// we are quitting, and whether an icon exists — and carries out the answer.
//
// THE CLOSE IS NEVER BLOCKED. `preventDefault` here always comes with a `hide()` in the same
// statement; there is no path on which the user presses X and nothing happens.
//
// THE OVERLAYS ARE UNTOUCHED BY A HIDE, and that is the whole feature rather than a detail. The
// main window's `close` handler in windows.ts destroys every overlay and the cursor ring — an
// accessory must never keep the app alive — so the hide path has to return BEFORE it. That is why
// the interceptor is a predicate the destroy handler asks first, rather than a listener of its
// own: Electron runs `close` listeners in registration order and a `preventDefault` from one does
// not stop the others from RUNNING, so a second listener would have watched the overlays go.
//
// THE CYCLE WITH windows.ts IS DELIBERATE AND CHEAP. This file imports the window handles and the
// shared `WEB_PREFERENCES`; windows.ts imports exactly one predicate back. Both sides are function
// declarations, main is bundled into a single chunk by electron-vite, and the alternative — a
// registration seam windows.ts hands its close decision to — costs that file lines it does not
// have (it sits exactly at the 400-code-line ceiling).

// `?asset` import hands the file to electron-vite's asset pipeline, which emits it beside the main
// bundle and rewrites this to the emitted path — so it ships with no electron-builder change.

 * (tests/e2e/close-to-tray.e2e.mts). It still creates no Tray and still shows no popover — the
 * popover is anchored to an icon rectangle that does not exist — it only makes the interceptor
 * answer 'hide', so a test can assert that the window survived and the overlays did too. Every
