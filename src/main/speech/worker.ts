// worker.ts — Kokoro inference, on a WORKER THREAD. The only file that loads onnxruntime.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT ON THE MAIN THREAD (plan decision D2, and the whole reason this file
// exists). Main runs the log pipeline: the tailer, `parseEvent`, every module's fold, the
// combat engine, the 1s tick. A Kokoro synthesis is 0.9–1.4 seconds of pegged CPU inside a
// native call that does not yield — measured on this machine, this model. On the main thread
// that is a second of frozen DPS meter, a second of un-tailed log, a second of alerts not
// evaluating, every time an alert says a word it has not said before. There is no amount of
// "it's usually cached" that makes that acceptable, because the uncached case is precisely
// the exciting moment (a new mob, a new spell) the meter is being watched for.
//
// SO: `new Worker()` on first `speech:say`, kept warm afterwards. The ~500 ms session
// creation and the ~170 ms espeak-ng WASM warm-up are paid ONCE per app run, on a thread
// nothing else is waiting on.
//
// THE PIPELINE, end to end:
//
//   text ──espeak-ng(wasm)──► IPA ──normalize──► token ids ──┐
//                                                            ├──► onnxruntime ──► float samples
//   voice id ──► style vector for THIS token count ──────────┘         (int8 Kokoro v1.0)
//                                                                              │
//                                            <userData>/speech-cache/<hash>.wav ◄─ 16-bit wav
//
// PHONEMIZATION IS espeak-ng COMPILED TO WASM (`phonemizer`, Apache-2.0, zero dependencies,
// no install script, ~1.3 MB of pure JS). Kokoro's reference JS port uses exactly this
// package. A NATIVE espeak-ng binding was rejected on purpose: it would be the tree's only
// module needing a compile step, it would collide with `.npmrc ignore-scripts=true`, and it
// would need per-platform prebuilds for a feature that is off by default.
//
// SERIALIZED BY CONSTRUCTION. Jobs run one at a time through a promise chain. onnxruntime
// would happily run two sessions concurrently and eat two cores — on a machine that is also
// running EverQuest, which is the entire point of this app. One alert at a time is also the
// natural rate: they are spoken one after another anyway.
//
// EVERY FAILURE IS A MESSAGE, NEVER A CRASH. A missing model, a corrupt voice pack, an
// unknown voice, a phonemizer throw — each answers `{ok:false, error}` for that one job. The
// worker stays alive, and `engine.ts` turns the failure into `{ok:false}` on `speech:say`,
// which W2's renderer already degrades to the system voice (the fallback seam, unbroken).
