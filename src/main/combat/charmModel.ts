// THE CHARM / CROWD-CONTROL OWNERSHIP MODEL (Task #65) — and, since JOS-188, the one place
// that answers "did this caster-less line resolve one of MY casts?" for a third family too.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHY THIS EXISTS: the two lines that bound a pet name a caster to nobody.
//
//   `<mob> has been charmed.`      `<mob> has been mesmerized.`
//
// Both are BROADCASTS. They are the wiki's `msg_cast_on_other` for the charm and mez
// families — the DB literally records them as `Someone has been charmed.` /
// `Someone has been mesmerized.` — so every player in the zone sees them and NONE of them
// names the caster. The engine used to bind every charm broadcast into `petNames`
// unconditionally and to open a 120s CC hold on every mez broadcast, which meant another
// enchanter's pet became YOUR pet and another enchanter's mez pinned YOUR fight open.
//
// Measured on the real log (eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt, 2026-08-04):
//   381 charm broadcasts   — 366 the owner cast, 15 cast by ten OTHER players.
//   2,899 CC broadcasts    — 2,797 correlate with an own cast, 102 do not.
// One foreign block (Tue Aug 04 16:59, the player Scooba's Allure VII pets) put 91 hits /
// 10,016 points of a stranger's pet damage on the owner's meter inside a single seven-minute
// window, entered the PLAYER Scooba into the owner's `engaged` set as a hostile, booked his
// self-heals as enemy healing, and — because his presence kept refreshing — merged three
// separate pulls into one 214-second "a Champion of Innoruuk +3" segment.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE RULE: a broadcast binds only when it RESOLVES ONE OF THE OWNER'S OWN CASTS.
//
// `You begin casting <Spell>.` is printed for the player and NOBODY else (a stranger's cast
// prints `<Name> begins casting <Spell>.`, which this parser does not emit at all). So an own
// cast of a charm/CC spell ARMS the model for that spell's own cast time plus a slack, and a
// broadcast inside the arm is ours. Everything else is somebody else's business.
//
// THE ARM WINDOW IS PER-SPELL, NOT A FLAT CONSTANT — measured, and it overturned the
// briefed "<= 2s". Delta from `You begin casting X.` to the broadcast, whole log:
//
//   spell               DB cast time   n     min   p50   max
//   Charm                     2400ms   95      0     2     3
//   Beguile                   3500ms   53      1     3     4
//   Cajoling Whispers         5500ms   59      1     5     6
//   Allure                    6000ms  159      2     4     5
//   Dazzle / Mesmerization  2500-3000ms       0     1     4
//
// The delta tracks the SPELL'S CAST TIME (log timestamps are second-granular, so it lands
// within ±1s of it). A flat 2s window would have bound Charm and missed 271 of the 366 real
// owner charms. `castTimeMs + CAST_SLACK_MS` binds 366/366 and 0/15 foreign — a perfect split
// on this log, with no other evidence needed.

   *
   * `spellKeys` are the landing message's candidates. The message alone proves nothing —
   * `goes berserk.` resolves to Burnout / Fury / Rage / Voice of the Berserker and three of
   * those four are ordinary buffs — so the armed cast must be AMONG them, which is the same

   * landing inside the same window is a different spell's business (a Quick Buff burst prints
   * eleven landings in one second — one cast, one bind).
   *
   * `spellKeys` COMES FROM THE DB, WHICH MAKES THIS TEST ONLY AS GOOD AS THE SCRAPE (JOS-349). A
   * pet-only spell whose third-person message carries a subject token the suffix table cannot key
   * is in no candidate list, so this returns false forever and the pet is never bound — measured on
   * `Tiny Companion` (`Target shrinks.`), which cost a reporter his whole pet. The rule is right;
   * the DB row was not. See `petClaims.bindPetBuffLanding` for the full characterization and the six
   * pet-only spells still in that state.
