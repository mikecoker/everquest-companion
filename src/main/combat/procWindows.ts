// THE PPM ENGINE + THE MINUTE-WINDOW LEDGER (docs/plans/proc-analytics.md §4.2–4.3, §5.1–5.2).
//
// Two things live here, and they share a file because they share every constant:
//
//   1. `procRate()` — the THREE denominators. All carried, none hidden, and every one of them
//      ABSENT below its sample floor rather than 0 (law 5). `1 proc in a 2-second pull` is not
//      `30 ppm`, and a meter that prints it once will print it forever.
//   2. `WindowAccum` — the wall-clock-minute ledger the Tier-B counterfactual needs. This
//      module builds and QUERIES the windows (the eligibility partition); the comparison
//      itself — medians, IQRs, verdicts, confounds — is a later wave and deliberately not
//      here.
//
// ACTIVE TIME IS REUSED, NEVER REDEFINED. `Encounter.activeMs` is Σ over consecutive
// ATTRIBUTED damage hits of `min(gap, ACTIVE_MS)` with the first hit adding 0 (routing.ts).
// The window ledger does not recompute that: ingest hands it the exact per-hit delta the
// engine just accrued, so the two can never drift.
//
// A CAVEAT THAT IS LABELED, NOT FIXED: route() accrues activeMs BEFORE the incoming/outgoing
// split, so incoming damage extends active time too — a pull where you are being beaten on
// while stunned accrues active seconds you did not swing in. Changing that would move
// `activeDps`, a SHIPPED number, and violate the byte-identical regression gate. So the number
// keeps the meter's meaning and the UI states it. `per100Swings` exists precisely because it
// has no such ambiguity.

 * THE RATE-AWARE EXPOSURE GATE, and the number is a count of PROCS, not of swings.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS REPLACES THE PLAN'S `MIN_INACTIVE_SWINGS = 200` (§4.3), which contradicted the plan's
 * own narrative and was shipped in wave 1 with the contradiction written down rather than
 * silently resolved. docs/plans/proc-analytics.md fixed a FLAT floor of 200 inactive swings
 * while ALSO stating that Instrument of Nife — 289 inactive swings against 261,505 active ones
 * — must come out 'inconclusive' (§0.3, §2.1). 289 > 200, so as specified it came out
 * 'exclusive': the exact claim the plan spent a section refusing to make.
 *
 * A flat swing floor cannot express the judgement, because the judgement is not about swings at
 * all. "It never fired without it" is evidence only in proportion to how many firings the
 * inactive arm SHOULD have produced. So the gate is the lane's OWN observed rate, projected
 * onto the inactive exposure:
 *
 *     expected = inactiveSwings × (withCount / activeSwings)
 *
 * and the link may leave 'inconclusive' only when that expectation reaches this many procs. On
 * the real log the two named cases separate cleanly and for the right reason:
 *
 *   Instrument of Nife  1,084 procs / 261,505 active swings = 0.41 per 100 swings.
 *                       289 inactive swings ⇒ ~1.2 expected procs. Seeing zero is barely
 *                       evidence at all ⇒ 'inconclusive'. (A flat 200-swing floor said
 *                       'exclusive'.)
 *   Spellblade (w39)    14 procs / 406 active swings = 3.4 per 100 swings.
 *                       225 inactive swings ⇒ ~7.8 expected procs. Seeing zero is a real
 *                       measurement ⇒ 'exclusive'.
 *
 * Three, not five or ten: below three expected firings a null result is ordinary luck (at
 * λ = 3 a Poisson zero still happens 5% of the time — which is about as far as an
 * observational co-occurrence count deserves to be pushed), and raising it further would
 * silence the one genuine exclusivity this log contains.
 *
 * TIER B IS INDEPENDENT of this and reaches the same verdict for Nife by a different route: 289
 * swings cannot fill 20 eligible 60-second windows, so the counterfactual reports
 * 'insufficient-sample' whatever this gate says.
