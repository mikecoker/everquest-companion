// THE ACTIVE-STATE TIMELINE (docs/plans/proc-analytics.md §3) — "what was on at time T", as
// an interval model with EVIDENCE on both edges.
//
// WHY IT LIVES IN THE COMBAT ENGINE. Three of the four kinds already have exactly one owner
// here: EngineState owns `stance` / `invocation` and the two-slot coat state, and
// `Encounter.stanceSpans` is already a span list. A parallel service would fork state that has
// one owner today, and forked state drifts. The BuffsModule is the wrong home and cannot be
// the home — it is reached only via `registry.snapshot(id)` (there is no cross-module read
// path), and its job is MINING DURATIONS under own-cast gating, which is a different question
// from "was this on at time T"; it cannot see stances or coats at all.
//
// DELIBERATELY NOT MERGED with `Encounter.stanceSpans`: that list is consumed by the shipped
// TimelineView and sits inside the byte-identical regression surface. Two lists, one shared
// writer (procRouting.applyStance). This ring is SESSION-level and purely additive.
//
// LAW 1 IS THE SHAPE OF THIS FILE. The game prints a state's START (a stance commit, a coat
// line, a buff landing). It almost never prints the END — the real log carries 97
// `Instrument of Nife` landings against ONE observed fade. So every edge is labeled: only a
// line the game printed earns 'observed'; a replacing sibling is 'inferred'; a severed
// boundary is 'censored' and NEVER renders as an end time.

 *                             previous span. The game prints no "your stance ends" line.
 *   'coat:utility'          — one slot; a new utility coat replaces the old one.
 *   'coat:combat:<key>'     — combat venoms STACK (wiki, Rogue page; proved by the real log),
 *                             so each venom is its own group and only a RE-coat of the SAME
 *                             venom supersedes.
 *   'buff:<key>'            — a re-apply supersedes its own span; unrelated buffs coexist.
 *
 * `group` is engine-internal on purpose: `spansOverlapping()` projects plain `StateSpan`s, so
 * the shared payload type never grows a field the renderer has no use for.
