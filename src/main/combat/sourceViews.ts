// THE COMBINE-PETS FOLD USED TO LIVE HERE AND IS GONE (owner ruling, 2026-08-04). It merged each
// pet's lanes into a synthetic "You +pets" source with namespaced skill names ("Vebarn: Slash")
// and no pet row at all — a SECOND presentation of the same numbers, alongside the renderer's
// `petRows`, and the two disagreed on screen: the Combat tab showed the pet as a drillable line
// item while the floating overlay (the fold's only consumer) showed merged lanes. "They should be
// using the same underlying api and abstraction — if not, collapse." So: one abstraction, in the
// renderer, where a LAYOUT belongs; this module now emits exactly the engine's own attribution —
// you and each pet as their own authoritative row — and every meter lays it out with petRows.
// The fold's parameter is gone from `sourceViews`, `buildView`, `buildSelected`, `snapshot()` and
// `SnapshotOpts` too: a flag no caller can pass is not a seam a second fold can grow back in.
