// THE ACTIVE SPECIAL ATTACK — stateful lane attribution for the specials that print no verb
// of their own. Fixes user report 01KZ9AAQ4ES1R2NVYK0JJ68EBQ ("Dragon Punch DPS isn't tracked").
//
// THE PROBLEM, measured on the real log (1.35M lines, sweep 2026-08-05). EQ Legends' upgraded
// special attacks never announce themselves in the damage line. The game states the switch once:
//
//   [Tue Jul 28 22:07:16 2026] You will now use Eagle Strike instead of Tiger Claw while attacking.
//   [Wed Jul 29 14:54:14 2026] You will now use Dragon Punch instead of Eagle Strike while attacking.
//
// …and from then on every one of those specials lands as the GENERIC verb `strike`:
//
//   [Wed Jul 29 15:05:14 2026] You strike a frenzied ghoul for 32 points of damage. (Critical)
//   [Wed Jul 29 15:05:14 2026] You have become better at Dragon Punch! (84)
//
// The damage was always COUNTED — `meleeSkill('strike')` answered "Melee" then, so it folded into
// the anonymous melee lane and no Dragon Punch row could ever exist. This module supplies the
// missing half: the log's own statement of which special is live, joined to the swing by VERB.
// (JOS-163 later gave the verb its own neutral floor — `meleeSkill('strike')` answers "Strike"
// now — so an unnamed strike is no longer pooled with slash/crush/hit. That changed the FLOOR;
// this module is still the only thing that can put a NAME on the lane, and it still wins.)
//
// ── THE LANES, AND WHY EXACTLY THESE TWO ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A "lane" is one generic verb plus the chain of specials that print with it. The table below is
// HAND-AUTHORED AND EVIDENCE-VERIFIED (the shared/zones.ts precedent, world-model law 12): a
// name-matcher would happily invent lanes the log never demonstrated. Two lanes earned a row:
//
//   `strike` → Tiger Claw → Eagle Strike → Dragon Punch
//     The verb is EXCLUSIVE to the lane and the proof is a timestamp: the player's first-ever
//     `You strike …` line is [Tue Jul 28 16:09:17], THREE SECONDS after `You will now use Tiger
//     Claw while auto attacking.` at 16:09:14 — across nine prior days and hundreds of thousands
//     of swings he never once "struck". Base unarmed attacks print `hit`/`claw`/`punch` instead
//     (Hand to Hand skill-ups sit on those three, 130 of 141 distance-1 joins), and Eagle Strike
//     / Dragon Punch skill-ups are confined to their own eras (145/145 and 254/255).
//
//   `kick` → Kick → Round Kick → Flying Kick
//     Here the skill-up stream partitions PERFECTLY by era, which is as clean as this log gets:
//     Kick 296/296 ticks inside kick=Kick eras, Round Kick 190/190 inside kick=Round Kick,
//     Flying Kick 254/255 inside kick=Flying Kick. Not one tick of a displaced special. The
//     Aug 02 01:55 loadout swap is the control: its `Kick while auto attacking.` reset the lane
//     and the Flying Kick ticks stopped dead while Kick ticks resumed. Same bug as Dragon Punch,
//     one lane over — a Flying Kick monk's damage reads "Kick" today.
//
// ── THE IKSAR ARM OF THE STRIKE LANE (JOS-102, user report 01KZGADDMWEGAVPX9V95F8H4Y2) ──────
//
// "Tail Rake is missing from the DPS overview." It is the SAME BUG AS DRAGON PUNCH, one RACE
// over, and it lands here rather than in `meleeSkill()` — which is worth saying plainly, because
// the obvious reading of the report ("tail rake is a monk skill like kick and bash, so give it a
// verb") would have added a `tail rake` alternation to MELEE_VERBS and named a lane the game has
// never printed. THERE IS NO `tail rake` VERB. Tail Rake is an upgraded special, so like every
// other entry in this table it lands as the generic `strike`, and the ONLY line that names it is
// the state line:
//
//   You will now use Tail Rake instead of Eagle Strike while attacking.
//
// WHY IT GOES IN THE `strike` CHAIN AND NOWHERE ELSE — three independent sources agreeing:
//   1. The committed class table (src/main/data/classes.json, scraped, not authored) grants
//      `Tail Rake` to MNK at level 25 — the SAME class and the SAME level as `Dragon Punch`.
//      A shared level in a chain whose other rungs are 10/20/25 is a race variant of one rung,
//      not a fourth rung. (`classTables.test.mts` pins both facts.)
//   2. The EQ Legends wiki states the identical sentence for both: Dragon Punch "replaces Eagle
//      Strike as the Monk special punch attack", and "Iksar Monks get Tail Rake instead" — same
//      slot, same displaced special, same level, same cap.
//   3. The refusal test this module already applies: an entry earns its row only when the
//      generic verb it rides is EXCLUSIVE to the chain. `strike` passed that test in wave T on
//      the owner's own bytes (his first-ever `You strike` is three seconds after his Tiger Claw
//      grant), and Tail Rake inherits it by occupying a seat in that chain rather than opening a
//      new lane — no new verb is claimed, so the exclusivity evidence does not have to be re-won.
//
// THE OWNER IS NOT AN IKSAR, AND THIS IS THE INJECTED ARM. `tail rake` is ZERO in all three of
// his logs and in all 103 committed fixtures, in every casing, while `better at Dragon Punch!`
// ticks 255 times — the human arm of the very same chain. So no fixture can be cut for this and
// a reporter's slice never becomes one (AGENTS.md); `tests/combatTailRakeLane.test.mts` injects
// the state line instead, the petClaimWindows / mobLifetapPlayer / JOS-92 precedent, built by
// taking the owner's OWN verbatim Dragon Punch state line and swapping the race-variant name —
// the same "swap the name in an attested sentence" move those tests make. What is attested and
// what is constructed is written out in that file's header.
//
// That also makes law 8 trivially provable and the proof was run: every committed fixture
// replayed before and after (1,102 rows — per-segment out/in, per (source, category), per
// (source, lane)) came back BYTE-IDENTICAL. Nothing could move, because membership in this table
// does nothing until a `You will now use Tail Rake …` line is read, and no line in the tree says
// that. The behaviour is proven by the injection test instead.
//
// ── THE LANE THAT DID *NOT* EARN A ROW (this is the point of measuring) ──────────────────────
//
// `You will now use Slam instead of Bash while attacking.` is a real state line and Slam NEVER
// prints a `slam` verb — self `slam` lines: ZERO in the whole log, against 39,900 `bash` lines.
// So the shield lane looks structurally identical to the two above, and the obvious move is to
// relabel `bash` swings "Slam" during a Slam era. THE EVIDENCE REFUSES IT: 185 `You have become
// better at Bash!` ticks fire DURING Slam eras (and there is no `better at Slam!` line anywhere
// — 0 occurrences), so those bash swings are demonstrably still driving the Bash skill. Whatever
// Slam is here, it is not a thing that displaces Bash the way Dragon Punch displaces Eagle
// Strike. The `specialAttack` EVENT is still parsed and recorded for it; the lane label is not
// claimed. A documented non-distinguishable (law 6) beats a plausible guess.
//
// ── WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT USE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// SKILL-UPS ARE NOT AN INPUT. They corroborated the table above during the sweep and that is all
// they are good for: `You have become better at Tiger Claw!` keeps ticking 111 times after Tiger
// Claw was replaced, on a ~6-minute drip whose lines sit beside heals and DoT ticks with no
// swing anywhere near them. Inferring the live special from skill-ups would therefore have
// relabelled Dragon Punch swings "Tiger Claw". State comes from the state line (law 1).
//
// PRE-STATE IS HONEST BY OMISSION. Until a `You will now use` line has been seen for a lane,
// this module returns nothing and the parser's ordinary `meleeSkill()` answer stands — "Strike"
// for a strike, "Kick" for a kick. It never seeds a lane from the table's first entry, so it
// cannot claim a special the log has not stated the character has.
//
// THAT OMISSION USED TO COST THE ROW ENTIRELY, AND NOW IT ONLY COSTS THE NAME (JOS-163). The
// state line prints ONCE, at the level-up, so a log file that begins after it — fresh install,
// rotation, `/log on` enabled later — never contains it, and before JOS-163 that meant every
// strike a monk ever threw read "Melee" forever. `meleeSkill()` now answers "Strike" for the
// bare verb, so the lane exists on its own evidence and this module upgrades it to the real
// ability name whenever the log does state one. The refusal above is unchanged and load-bearing:
// the floor is the VERB, never the table's first entry.
//
// SELF ONLY. The state line has no third-person grammar (a full-log sweep found zero `now use`
// lines that are not `You will now use`), so nothing here can ever be known about a mob, a pet
// or another player. The caller gates on the attacker being You; this module could not label
// anyone else even if it wanted to.
