// feedback/queue.ts — the offline retry drain.
//
// A user files the bug when the app misbehaves, which correlates uncomfortably well with
// "their network is also unhappy". So a transport failure is not the end of a report: it is
// spooled (state.ts) and re-attempted later, over exactly the same wire, carrying the SAME
// `clientReportId`. That id is the server's idempotency key — a retry that races a successful
// first attempt gets the original `reportId` back, never a duplicate row (§6.4).
//
// The drain is deliberately dumb: it never re-slices the log (the bytes were captured when the
// user pressed Send and are what they previewed), never rewrites `env` (the environment the bug
// happened in is the interesting one), and gives up permanently on a 4xx.
//
// WIRED INTO STARTUP. `src/main/index.ts` (the composition root) calls `startQueueFlush()` once
// the tail has attached — first drain +30 s later, then every 30 min — and `stopQueueFlush()`
// from `window-all-closed`. Whether the loop runs at all is `queueFlushEnabled` (net.ts): never
// under `EQ_E2E=1`, never in a build with no endpoint compiled in.
