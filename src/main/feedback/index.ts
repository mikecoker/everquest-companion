// feedback/index.ts — THE PUBLIC SURFACE of the in-app feedback library.
//
// Six functions, and everything else in this directory is private to them. The IPC layer
// (`src/main/ipc/feedback.ts`) imports only from here, so the wiring can never reach around
// the façade into the slicer or the queue.
//
// ============================ THE ONE RULE ============================
// THE GAME LOG IS OPENED READ-ONLY AND IS NEVER WRITTEN TO. Every read in this feature goes
// through `slice.ts`, whose only fs call is `open(path, 'r')`.
// ======================================================================
//
// Design notes worth not relearning:
//   * NOTHING here throws. `submitFeedback` resolves a typed result for every outcome, and the
//     preview/save paths resolve null/`{ok:false}` rather than rejecting an IPC call.
//   * The network lives in the MAIN process only. The renderer performs no fetch/XHR —
//     `connect-src 'self'` makes it structurally impossible — and this feature needs ZERO CSP
//     changes. Wanting to widen `connect-src` for feedback is a sign the work is in the wrong
//     process.
//   * The endpoint is a compiled-in constant with no user-configurable override, ever: an
//     overridable ingest URL is an exfiltration primitive (net.ts).
