// ============================================================================
// feedback/perf.ts — THE GATHERING HALF of the report's perf block (JOS-369).
// ============================================================================
//
// `shared/feedbackPerf.ts` owns the arithmetic and the vocabulary — and can therefore be tested
// without an Electron process. THIS file owns the ASKING, and every question it asks is answered
// by our own probe, our own tail, our own windows, our own store, the OS or the driver. It is the
// same split `telemetry/setupSnapshot.ts` / `telemetry/setupFacts.ts` draw, and it is drawn in the
// same place for the same reason: no string from the machine, no path and no character identity
// survives the seam between the two files.
//
// ============================ THE ENVELOPE RULES, AS THEY APPLY HERE ============================
// The feedback envelope's laws (see `submit.ts` and `slice.ts`): nothing from the game log, no
// filesystem paths, and `installId` never joins `analyticsId`. This module reads NOTHING from the
// log — the only thing it knows about the tail is how long its reads TOOK — reads no path (the one
// file it consults, `eqclient.ini`, is read by `eqWindowMode()`, which returns one of three words
// and retains nothing else), and touches no identifier of any kind.
//
// NOTHING HERE THROWS AND NOTHING HERE IS REQUIRED. Every reading is wrapped independently: a
// store that refuses, an overlay registry mid-teardown, a GPU process that will not answer, an OS
// that will not report its own memory — each costs its own field and never the report. A
// diagnostic that can fail a bug report is worse than no diagnostic.
