// feedback/slice.ts — turn the live EverQuest log into a small, scrubbed, previewable artifact.
//
// ============================ THE ONE RULE ============================
// THE GAME LOG IS OPENED READ-ONLY AND IS NEVER WRITTEN TO. `open(path, 'r')`, one `read()`
// of the tail, `close()`. Not `'a'`, not `'w'`, not `'r+'`, not ever. The user is PLAYING
// while this runs; the log is the game's file and the app is a guest in it.
// ======================================================================
//
// The pipeline, in this order, because each step exists to make the next one affordable
// (docs/plans/feedback-triage.md §5.2):
//
//   1. BYTE-BOUNDED TAIL READ — at most the last TAIL_READ_CAP (16 MB). The live log is over
//      a million lines and grows every second; no report may ever load it whole. The first,
//      possibly-partial line of a truncated read is discarded.
//   2. TIME WINDOW anchored on the LAST LINE'S timestamp, never `Date.now()`. A user who
//      alt-tabbed out twenty minutes ago must not get an empty slice — the window means "the
//      last N minutes OF PLAY", which is the thing they are reporting about.
//   3. SCRUB — `src/shared/logScrub.ts scrubLines`, with the ACTIVE CHARACTER's name as
//      `selfName` so their own `/who` row survives and every stranger's does not. DROP the
//      line, never rewrite it (the scrub law: a rewritten line still parses into a fake event).
//   4. LINE CAP — keep the LAST MAX_SLICE_LINES (50k): the lines nearest the problem.
//   5. GZIP level 9. EQ logs are extremely repetitive and compress ~8-12x.
//   6. SIZE FIT — over MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES (2 MB gz), halve the window and retry, at most 3
//      times, then hard-truncate from the FRONT. Whatever survives is what the metadata
//      reports: the displayed span is always the ACTUAL span, never the requested one.
//
// This module is deliberately Electron-free and takes the log path + character name as
// PARAMETERS. That is what lets tests/feedbackSlice.test.mts drive the whole pipeline against
// synthetic files in a temp dir — the real game log is never touched by a test.
