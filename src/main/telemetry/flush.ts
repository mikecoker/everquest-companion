// telemetry/flush.ts — the session lifecycle and the flush loop that now actually sends.
//
// TWO JOBS, ONE TIMER (JOS-395 merged them; before that they were two `setInterval`s):
//
//   * THE HEARTBEAT (10 min) is COLLECTION. It records `sessionHeartbeat` into the local ring so
//     "how long do sessions actually last" survives a process that is killed rather than closed
//     — a `sessionEnd` that never fires is exactly the data point you most want. It runs
//     whenever the user's switch is on, endpoint or no endpoint, because nothing it does leaves
//     the machine.
//
//   * THE FLUSH (5 min) is NETWORK. It happens only when `telemetryFlushEnabled` says so: not
//     under e2e, not without an endpoint, not with the switch off, and NOT BEFORE THE FIRST-RUN
//     NOTICE HAS RENDERED. Same discipline as `startQueueFlush` — one predicate (net.ts), read
//     by the loop on every tick rather than once at startup, because two copies of a network
//     gate is how one of them drifts.
//
// WHY ONE TIMER AND NOT TWO, which is THE COINCIDENCE INVARIANT made structural. The heartbeat
// cadence is a MULTIPLE of the flush cadence on purpose: a heartbeat tick must also be a flush
// tick, so the pulse rides out on the same timer turn that recorded it rather than waiting five
// minutes for the next one, and `triage/liveSessions.ts` can keep reading one heartbeat per
// session per bucket. Two `setInterval`s made that true by luck — they were started microseconds
// apart and drifted only slowly. Once each tick carries its own ±5% jitter (JOS-395) luck is not
// good enough: two independently wobbling timers land up to 30 s apart and fire in either order,
// and the flush-first half of those is exactly the five-minute wait the invariant forbids. So
// there is ONE loop over ONE grid (`./schedule.ts`), the heartbeat is an INDEX on that grid
// (`isHeartbeatTick`), and it is recorded BEFORE the tick's flush reads the ring. Coincidence is
// then a property of the code's shape, not of two clocks agreeing.
//
// AND WHY THE FLUSH RIDES A TIMER IT DOES NOT GATE. "A timer that can only ever no-op is still not
// created" (the `startQueueFlush` precedent) survives this merge intact and is in fact honoured
// harder: the collection timer exists whenever the switch is on, and a shut network gate now costs
// one predicate call per tick instead of a second timer. Nothing reaches the network before the
// notice — `flushTelemetry` re-reads the gate first, every time.
//
// The loop's timers are `unref`'d, so neither the tick nor a pending retry can be the reason the
// process stays alive.
//
// WHY THOSE TWO NUMBERS AND NOT THE ORIGINAL 60 s / 5 min (JOS-269, owner cost ruling 2026-08-12).
// Every flush is ONE request through API Gateway, Lambda and DSQL — the three meters that cost
// money — and the free tier had a month in sight (Lambda at 911k of 1M). Nothing here is a click
// stream: every event is a COUNTER DELTA that the ingest Lambda sums server-side into a day's row,
// so ten deltas in one batch aggregate to exactly what ten batches of one would have. Batching is
// therefore free of information loss, and 60 s → 5 min is ~5x fewer requests from an active
// client while 5 min → 10 min halves the idle floor.
//
// WHAT IT DOES COST, stated rather than hidden: TIME RESOLUTION on a session that is KILLED. A
// clean exit still reports `sessionEnd` with the exact uptime; a process that dies is only known
// to have lived as long as its last heartbeat said, so the worst-case understatement of such a
// session goes from just under 5 minutes to just under 10. That is a coarsening of the tail of the
// duration histogram, not a change to what is collected — the events, their fields and their
// buckets are untouched, and telemetry CONTENT is owner law that this ticket does not get to move.
//
// AND ONE THING THAT MUST NOT MOVE WITH IT: the "not now" arm of `flushTelemetry` below. The
// server's throttle is being halved in the same release, so 429 gets MORE likely, not less — the
// buffer keeps its records and the next tick tries again, exactly as before. A longer flush period
// makes that patience cheaper, never optional.
//
// WIRED INTO STARTUP from `src/main/index.ts` (the composition root), immediately beside
// `startQueueFlush()`, and stopped from `window-all-closed` beside `stopQueueFlush()`.
