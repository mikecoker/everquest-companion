// ============================================================================
// telemetry/liveRiders.ts — what a RUNNING session reports about itself (JOS-367).
// ============================================================================
//
// THE GATHERING HALF. `./liveFacts.ts` owns the arithmetic (and can therefore be tested); this
// file owns the asking, and every question it asks is answered by our own probe, our own tail,
// our own windows, our own store or the OS. None of it comes from log CONTENT, and no path or
// name survives the seam between the two files — the same boundary `setupSnapshot.ts` /
// `setupFacts.ts` draw, one subject over.
//
// DRAINED BY WHICHEVER SESSION REPORT FIRES FIRST — `sessionHeartbeat` or `sessionEnd`, exactly
// like `linesParsed` and the startup reading. That is what makes the fleet-wide numbers a sum of
// DELTAS: each interval is reported once, and a session that is killed loses at most its last
// window rather than double-counting an earlier one.
//
// NOTHING HERE THROWS AND NOTHING HERE IS REQUIRED. Each of the three groups is wrapped
// independently: a store that refuses, an overlay registry mid-teardown, an OS that will not
// answer for its own memory — each costs its own group and never the report, and never the
// session. A diagnostic that can fail a heartbeat is worse than no diagnostic.
//
// `recordEvent` IS STILL THE GATE. Nothing here consults the user's switch: the events these ride
// on are written through the one function that checks it, once, like every other producer.
