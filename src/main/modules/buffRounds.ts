// buffRounds.ts — ONE ANSWER TO "HOW MANY OF THAT NAME ARE HELD, AND WHICH ONE JUST ENDED"
// (JOS-140, rulings 5 and 7). Pure: no events, no clock of its own, no Electron.
//
// THE PROBLEM, MEASURED. EQ stamps are second-resolution and print no instance identifier, so one
// AE mez landing on five mobs that share a name is FIVE BYTE-IDENTICAL LINES in one second. The
// reporter's slice (01KZJHXJVAA7FNRDW83CTAYSF8) does exactly that nine times over three minutes:
// nine casts, fifty landings, twenty-one wear-offs, across four distinct names. The old CC half
// kept one hold per NAME and overwrote its clock on every line, so a round of nine landings became
// four rows and the first wear-off deleted a row that four more wear-offs then failed to find.
//
// THE MODEL. One group per (spell line, entity NAME). A group holds a LIST of landings, oldest
// first — one per mob of that name we believe is held — and the UI draws ONE ROW with a COUNT CHIP
// (ruling 7), because five identical rows with five identical clocks is noise, not information.
//
// A ROUND is every landing sharing one log second. Its rule is the only interesting thing here:
//
//   a round of N landings on a group already holding M refreshes min(N, M) of them, NEWEST FIRST,
//   and appends the remaining max(0, N - M).
//
// Both halves of that are the owner's ruling and both are load-bearing. REFRESHING rather than
// appending is what keeps a re-mez of five mobs at a count of five instead of ten — the count is
// what is held, not what has ever landed. NEWEST-first refresh, paired with OLDEST-first closing
// below, is what makes the row's clock a prediction of the next wear-off line rather than an
// average of several.
//
// CLOSING IS OLDEST-FIRST, for the same reason and with the same honesty: `Your <S> spell has worn
// off of <mob>.` names the mob but not WHICH mob of that name, so under a fixed duration the
// oldest landing is the maximum-likelihood one to have just ended. Nothing else in the log
// separates them (world-model law 6's non-distinguishables).
//
// CLEAN CYCLES (ruling 5) are the whole reason the bookkeeping is this careful. A duration sample
// may be minted ONLY from a landing that was alone in its round, on a group that was empty when
// the round opened, and that nothing touched before its wear-off. Everything else — a same-second
// sibling, a refresh, a wear-off with no hold behind it, a zone/death/gap clear — CONTAMINATES,
// and a contaminated landing mints nothing. Measured against the reporter's slice this admits
// exactly two of fifty-eight cycles (43 s and 44 s), which is the correct yield for a fifteen
// minute AE-mez grind: they are the two rounds whose mob name happened to be unique.
