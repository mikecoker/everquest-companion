// classUnlocks module (JOS-148) — the classes this character may run as a primary, as the LOG
// stated them, in the order it stated them.
//
// It is the smallest module in the tree on purpose: one event kind in, an append-only list out.
// There is no resolution to do, because there is nothing to resolve — `classUnlock` is the one
// line in EQ Legends that answers the question outright, and world-model law 1 says a message
// beats an inference. The Plane of Sky tab derives the OTHER half (how many of a class's tests
// you have turned in) from the JOS-131 ledger, and composes the two at the read boundary.
//
// DEDUPED BY CLASS, first sighting wins. The achievement can only fire once per class per
// character, so a second row for the same class would mean a re-scan re-read the same line
// rather than a second unlock. Keeping the FIRST instant is what makes the timestamp worth
// carrying: it dates the unlock, not the last time the app happened to read the log.
//
// EPOCH RESETS IT, exactly as the turn-in ledger is reset (Task #49). A pre-launch beta
// character's unlocks belong to a dead character that shares this log file, and reporting them
// against the current one is the same contamination that made the AA tallies wrong. The owner's
// own unlock lands on the right side of the boundary anyway (Jul 28 15:51, hours after the
// launch anchor), so the reset costs nothing real and refuses the case it exists for.
