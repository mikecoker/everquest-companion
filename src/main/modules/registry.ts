// The module registry: the single owner of the extension push loop.
//
// Responsibilities:
//   - hold the registered modules (registration order = bus delivery order),
//   - subscribe each to the LogBus so they fold every event,
//   - after LIVE events, schedule a trailing ~100ms flush; for each module a
//     non-null flushDelta() is pushed to the renderer as `module:delta`,
//   - answer `module:getSnapshot(id)` by returning that module's snapshot().
//
// During historical replay (live:false) modules fold silently and NO flush is
// scheduled — the renderer hydrates via getSnapshot once, then rides deltas. The
// seq on every delta/snapshot is the last LogEvent seq the module consumed, which
// the renderer uses for gap detection + dupe rejection.
//
// "SILENTLY" USED TO MEAN "NO FLUSH IS SCHEDULED", WHICH IS NOT THE SAME THING (JOS-60).
// Modules ACCUMULATE their pending deltas while folding — no `onEvent` in the tree looks at
// `live` before appending to its pending list — so the replay leaves a full delta sitting in
// every module. Two callers then shipped it: `tick()`, driven by session.ts's 1-second wall-clock
// heartbeat, which belongs to the PREVIOUS character and keeps firing straight through the new
// one's replay; and the `flushNow()` at the end of `tailCharacter`, one statement before
// `log:character`. Either way the renderer received ANOTHER CHARACTER'S ENTIRE HISTORY as an
// INCREMENT against the state it was still holding — and an increment is exactly what every
// always-mounted celebration detector is watching for. MEASURED on a padded two-character e2e
// install: a `kills` delta carrying a boss the previous character never killed, delivered 1.7 s
// before `log:character`, firing the seeded bossDefeat alert on every switch back.
//
// So a replay is now a STATE, not just a flag on each event: `beginReplay()` / `endReplay()`
// bracket it, nothing is pushed while it is in flight, and what it accumulated is DISCARDED
// rather than flushed. Discarding loses nothing — everything the replay folded is in
// `snapshot()`, and `log:character` makes every consumer re-hydrate from exactly that.
