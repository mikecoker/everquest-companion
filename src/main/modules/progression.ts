// progression module — the range-queryable time series behind the leveling analytics
// (docs/plans/leveling-analytics.md §3). Folds experience, CREDITED kills, witnessed kills,
// loot (an activity signal), the zone timeline and a mirror of the tiny level/AA series into
// ONE columnar snapshot, so `shared/progressionStats.rangeStats` has a single input.
//
// WHY NOT extend LevelingModule (leveling.ts stays byte-untouched):
//   1. DIFFERENT CAP POLICY. LevelingSnap is deliberately uncapped — the AA identity (law 5)
//      needs the whole history, and 81 levels + 139 AA gains over 6 days is nothing. This
//      series grows at ~1.7k rows/day and MUST be capped. Folding a drop-oldest ring into a
//      snapshot whose contract is "everything, forever" is a semantic trap.
//   2. DISJOINT OWNERSHIP. leveling.ts / levelSeries.ts untouched keeps the swap-series
//      golden tests (tests/levelingSwapWindows.test.mts) an unmodified regression gate.
// It duplicates the ~220 level/AA rows on purpose (cheap) but duplicates no DERIVATION — the
// AA identity stays in shared/aa.ts and is NOT what `aaGained` reports (see rangeStats).
//
// KILL CREDIT. `killTs` holds only kills the log attributes to YOU: your own killing blow
// (`You have slain X!`) plus a BOUND PET's (`X has been slain by <pet>!`). Measured post-epoch:
// 2999 self + 1111 bound-pet = 4110 credited against 4157 exp lines in the same span (98.9%) —
// a strong correlation, never an identity (group-mates' killing blows still pay party exp;
// grey kills pay nothing). The 954 THIRD-PARTY kills go to `witnessTs` and enter no rate, so a
// busy zone cannot silently inflate your farming numbers. `killer` starting with "you" is
// dropped as the de-dupe of the self shape, exactly as reducers.ts `isCountedKill` does.
//
// PET BINDING mirrors the combat engine (combat/ingest.ts), which is the repo's established
// semantics, with the ONE distinction a world-model-less module can still make (law 4):
// summoned pets persist across zones, charmed pets do not. So claims and charms are kept in
// two sets and a zone line clears only the charmed one. A charmed mob also sends the pet-claim
// tell, so a claim for a name already charmed is ignored rather than promoted to "summoned" —
// the same rule `world.claim()` applies when it leaves an already-charmed instance alone.

//
// THE RECENT-KILLS RING + THE EXPERIENCE JOIN. The columns above carry no names, so a small
// bounded ring (RECENT_KILL_CAP rows, drop-oldest) records WHAT each credited kill was and what
// it paid. The pairing is MEASURED, not assumed:
//
//   FULL-LOG SWEEP (read-only, 1.11M lines): 4909 experience lines, 5988 slain lines. For 4887
//   of the 4909 the nearest slain line is the one AFTER it, and the timestamp gap is 0 s (4856)
//   or 1 s (25). The experience line PRECEDES its kill line — always, and essentially always in
//   the same second. Not one experience line in the log follows its kill inside 4 s.
//
// OFFLINE INTERVALS. The one column here that is not a log line but a DERIVED absence: the
// `offlineGap` events sessionDetector.ts synthesizes at each login line, carrying the instants
// the character left and re-entered the world. Folded verbatim (no merging, no inference), and
// deliberately NOT applied to anything else in this module — the columns record what the log
// said, and `shared/progressionStats.rangeStats` is the single place that decides what a
// logout means for idle time, active time and every rate. That split is what keeps a range
// query over a snapshot with no offline intervals byte-identical to what it always was.
//
// So the join looks BACKWARD: a kill takes the most recent UNCLAIMED experience line within
// KILL_EXP_JOIN_MS before it. That makes the ring row complete the instant it is created, which
// is why the delta stays a pure append with no patch channel and no deferred commit.
// An experience line is CONSUMED by the first kill line that claims it and can never be
// attributed twice — including by a WITNESSED kill, which consumes without recording: a
// group-mate's kill pays party experience, and letting that line survive would hand it to your
// own next kill seconds later. A kill with no line in its window carries no exp at all, which
// the UI states as such — never as 0% (law 1).
