// itemTiers module (Task #60) — the per-item OBSERVED item level ("tier") for the items the
// CURRENT character has actually upgraded.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. The wiki documents BASE items only (per-INSTANCE tier is not on any item
// page), so before this the ItemWindow could draw its tier meter for exactly one reason: the
// display name in front of it happened to carry ` +N`. Look up "Ghoulbane" and the window had
// nothing to say about the Ghoulbane +4 in your bags. The log DOES say it — once, at the
// moment of the merge — so we fold those statements into character-scoped state.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS EVIDENCE (law 1: messages over inference; unknown ≠ zero). Only MERGE
// evidence — a line where the game told us an upgraded item came into existence in OUR hands:
//   1. `itemMerge` with a tier — `You have successfully merged two items together to create a
//      new item: <Name> +N`. (Rank-suffixed spell-scroll merges carry no tier and are counted
//      as merges only — never as an item level.)
//   2. loot with disposition 'combined' — the auto-merge-on-pickup line
//      `You looted <item> … to create a <item> +N`; `created` is the result, same as (1).
//   3. `itemMergeFailed` reason 'mismatch' — `Your request to merge <target> with
//      <component> failed. …` The line quotes YOUR item's name verbatim, tier suffix and
//      all, so it is a direct statement that you hold that item at that tier.
// Ordinary loot of a `+N` drop is deliberately NOT evidence: an unmerged drop is routinely
// auto-sold or destroyed on pickup (the log shows both), so it says nothing about what you
// KEEP and would mint a tier for an item you never upgraded. The real log makes the
// distinction visible: four `Kitchen Toolbelt +4` drops were looted post-launch and all four
// were destroyed minutes later.
//
// AND A DESTROY RETIRES NOTHING HERE (JOS-401, the census). The destroy line is parsed now
// (`disposition: 'destroyed'`), and this module still folds only 'combined' loot rows, on the same
// reasoning the parser's sweep gave it: `tier` is the HIGHEST tier ever OBSERVED for a base name,
// which is a fact about a merge that happened and never a claim about what is in your bags today.
// Destroying the Kitchen Toolbelt +4 does not un-observe the merge that made it. The counting
// surfaces that DO claim current inventory (posky/heldCounts.ts, inventory/reconcile.ts) are where
// the subtraction lives.
//
// WHAT IT NEVER CLAIMS. Item exp WITHIN a tier is unobservable (no log line reports it), so
// nothing here models progress toward the next tier — the UI draws position only. An item we
// have never merged has NO row: absent means UNKNOWN, never tier 0.
//
// TIER SEMANTICS: `tier` is the HIGHEST tier ever observed for the item's base name, not the
// latest. Merges are per-INSTANCE and the user levels several copies of the same item in
// parallel — the real log has `Whitened Treant Fists +1, +2, +2, +3, +3, +4` inside one
// minute (two instances climbing together), so "latest" would report +3 for a bag holding a
// +4. `lastTier` keeps the most recent result for anyone who wants the raw sequence.
//
// CHARACTER-SCOPED, EPOCH-AWARE. Item tiers belong to a character exactly like loot/kills/
// leveling do: the beta character (wiped at the 2026-07-28 launch, same log file) merged a
// Kitchen Toolbelt to +5 and Pristine Studded Leather to +4, none of which the current
// character owns. On the derived `epoch` event we drop the whole map, same as loot.ts.
//
// NAMES ARE DIRTY (law 2): rows are keyed by `itemTierKey` (lowercased, ` +N` stripped) — the
// shared counting-boundary rule loot already uses — while `name` keeps the RAW base name for
// display ("Thelvorn, Blade of Light", commas and all).
