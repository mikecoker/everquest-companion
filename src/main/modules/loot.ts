// loot module — the self-loot history. Wraps the pure loot fold from reducers.ts
// (a LootEvent tagged with the zone it happened in). Delta = the rows appended
// since the last flush; the renderer concats them.
//
// IT CARRIES THE DESTROY UNCHANGED (JOS-401, the census). `disposition: 'destroyed'` rides the
// same row shape, the same append-only history, the same delta — which is the whole reason the
// destroy was given a disposition instead of an event kind of its own. This module takes NO
// position on what it means; `shared/lootDisposition.ts` is where each reader states one. The zone
// tag rides along too and is honest: a destroy happens somewhere, even though it names no mob.
