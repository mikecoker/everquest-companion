// consider module (Task #63) — "what have I been sizing up, and what does it drop".
//
// A capped ring of RECENTLY CONSIDERED mobs, served over the ordinary module transport
// (`module:getSnapshot` / `module:delta`), enriched ASYNCHRONOUSLY with drop knowledge.
//
// ONE ROW PER MOB. A mob conned five times during one pull is one row with `cons: 5`, not five
// rows — the real log does that constantly (the biggest run is a goblin magician conned nine
// times inside 30 seconds), and five identical lines answer "what have I been sizing up" worse
// than one. The row carries the MOST RECENT con's facts; re-conning moves it to the front.
//
// ENRICHMENT NEVER BLOCKS THE EVENT PATH. `mobLookup` may need the network, so the row is
// appended immediately from the log line alone and `knowledge` lands later as its own delta —
// the same shape the event feed's loot probe uses. A lookup that fails leaves `knowledge`
// absent, which is the honest state (law 1); it is never filled with an empty record to mean
// "we checked".
//
// HISTORY vs LIVE — deliberately DIFFERENT from the event feed. The feed admits nothing
// historical because a feed is a stream of things that just happened. This ring is a STATE
// ("the mobs you've been conning"), so the startup replay DOES fold into it and the card is
// populated the moment the app opens. What replay does NOT do is fire hundreds of wiki lookups:
// enrichment is live-only, plus a bounded BACKFILL of the newest rows on the first wall-clock
// tick (which the registry only ever calls once the live tail is running — that tick is the
// module contract's "the replay is over" edge). Everything else enriches on demand when the
// user actually hovers it, through the same cache-first `mobs:lookup` door.
//
// OWN-LOOT INDEX (mobLookup's LOCAL 1): this module is also what FEEDS it, folding every loot
// event — historical included, since your loot history is exactly what makes it useful — into
// the shared MobLootIndex. That keeps one owner for the character-scoped/epoch-scoped lifetime
// of that index instead of a second bus subscription that could reset out of step.
