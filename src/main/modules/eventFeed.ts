// eventFeed module (Task #59) — the live event log behind the 'events' overlay.
//
// A capped ring of FeedEvents ("things worth noticing"), served over the ordinary module
// transport (`module:getSnapshot` / `module:delta`) so the overlay window hydrates on open and
// then rides deltas exactly like every other view.
//
// THREE SOURCES, all of them existing detectors — this module invents nothing:
//   1. ALERTS   — index.ts hands every fire from the AlertsModule delta (main-side event/raw
//                 triggers) AND every renderer-routed 'app'-signal fire (alerts:appFired) to
//                 `noteAlertFire`. Cooldowns/enabled were already applied upstream.
//   2. LOOT     — a LIVE `loot` event kicks a cache-first item lookup (injected, so tests need
//                 no network); the row is appended ONLY if the item comes back NOTABLE by the
//                 shared predicate (lore / quest-flagged / used by a quest). This replaces the
//                 old bare prefetch call in index.ts — one lookup, same warm cache.
//   3. QUESTS   — the renderer's posky/turn-in detector reports a completion over `feed:report`
//                 (`report()`), because only the renderer can match turn-ins against posky.
//   4. CONSIDER — a LIVE `consider` line (Task #63): you sized something up, so the feed says
//                 what it was, how hard, and (via the row's hover card) what it drops. Unlike
//                 loot this needs no lookup to be admitted — the log line already carries every
//                 field of the row; drop knowledge is the HOVER's job, resolved lazily.
//
// HYDRATION (the celebration-detector rule, AGENTS.md "Celebrations"): the startup replay must
// NOT spam the feed with hours-old events. Rather than seeding a baseline and diffing, this
// module simply IGNORES every historical event — `onEvent` returns immediately when `live` is
// false, and the two out-of-band inputs (alerts, quest reports) are live-only by construction
// upstream. The ring therefore starts EMPTY and only ever contains events observed after the
// tail took over. That is the silent baseline, expressed as "nothing historical is admitted".
//
// HONESTY (law 1): a field is present only when something knows it. A quest whose dataset names
// no reward carries no `reward`, so the UI has no item hover to show — never a fabricated one.
