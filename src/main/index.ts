// ============================================================================
//
// Everything this file does is ORDERING. The pieces themselves live next door:
//
//   channel.ts     which `userData` dir this process gets (prod / dev / e2e) + the one-time
//                  state seed. FIRST import, always.
//   crashGuards.ts process-level uncaught-error capture. Second, so it covers every module
//                  body that follows.
//   pipeline.ts    the log-derived world: LogBus, module registry (+ REGISTRATION ORDER),
//                  combat engine, epoch detector, spell DB.
//   session.ts     the active character's lifetime: scan → live tail, heartbeat, inventory
//                  watch, EQ-dir changes.
//   windows.ts     every BrowserWindow (main + overlays) and the Electron-side trust boundary.
//   ipc/           the IPC surface, one module per domain.
//
// What remains here is the sequence those pieces must be assembled in, and the app lifecycle
// that drives it. FOUR orderings are load-bearing and are called out at their call sites:
// the first-import law, the epoch subscription being the LAST bus subscriber,
// `registerSchemesAsPrivileged` running at module scope (before `ready`), and graphics safe mode
// being applied at module scope for the same before-`ready` reason (graphics.ts).

// FIRST import on purpose: channel.ts picks this process's `userData` dir (prod / dev /
// e2e — Task #58) and runs the one-time state seed, before electron-store is constructed
// (module-level) further down this import list.
import { CHANNEL, USER_DATA } from './channel'
// SECOND on purpose: installs the uncaughtException/unhandledRejection sinks before any
// module body below can throw. See crashGuards.ts.

// cannot see. All of the reasoning lives in graphics.ts.

//
// This is the operator's window onto the feedback backlog — the same Aurora DSQL rows and S3
// slices `scripts/triage-feedback.mts` reads, over the same IAM door. It exists in the OWNER's
// dev app and nowhere else, and there are THREE independent reasons a shipped build cannot
// reach it:
//
//   1. THIS GATE, which is `OWNER_TOOLS` since JOS-72 (src/shared/ownerTools.ts) and no longer
//      "am I a dev build?". `app.isPackaged` is false in a dev run — but it is also false in a
//      SELF-COMPILED build from this public repo, which is how a stranger's macOS recompile
//      ended up with the owner's backlog tab in its nav drawer. So the predicate now also
//      requires `EQ_OWNER_TOOLS=1`, which no fresh checkout has; `E2E` still excludes the
//      headless harness, which builds production-shaped and must stay off the network. The
//      import is DYNAMIC, so a build without the opt-in never even evaluates the module.
//   2. THE DEPENDENCIES. That module reaches `pg` and `@aws-sdk/*` — devDependencies, which
//      electron-builder never packages. A build with this gate patched out still could not
//      resolve them. The property is structural, not a runtime check.
//   3. THE CREDENTIALS. Auth is an IAM token derived locally from the LAUNCHING SHELL's AWS
//      profile (AWS_PROFILE, default 'eqc'). There is no password to leak, and a shell without
//      the owner's credentials gets IAM denials on the first statement.
//
// Failure to load is logged and startup continues: a dev tool must never be able to take the
// app down. `closeDevTriage` is the teardown — a live DSQL socket would otherwise hold the
// process open, the same hang the CLI's `finally` exists for.
