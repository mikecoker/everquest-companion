// planner/validate.ts — the one place a stored PLAN is proven to be a plan: exaltation sets
// (`sanitizeExaltPlans`), gear sets since JOS-286 (`sanitizeGearSets`), and the flat wish list
// since JOS-326 (`sanitizeWishlist`).
//
// TWO CALLERS, ONE ANSWER (the ipc/knowledge + presencePrefs arrangement):
//   * `IPC.plannerSetPlans` runs it on the way IN. Renderer input is never trusted here, exactly
//     as `combo:setCorrection` and `sounds:getData` are not trusted — today's only caller being
//     the app's own UI is not a security property.
//   * `storePlans.getExaltPlans` runs it on the way OUT, so a hand-edited (or downgrade-written)
//     progress file cannot hand the renderer a shape it will crash on.
// Because both directions pass through here, "what is a valid plan" has exactly one definition
// and the round trip is a fixed point — which is what `tests/plannerStore.test.mts` asserts.
//
// It STRIPS rather than rejects (the profiles/share precedent): an unknown slot key, a fifth
// socket type, a class abbreviation that is not one of the sixteen, a socket with no donor —
// each is dropped and everything else is kept. Refusing the whole write over one bad field would
// lose a user's real work to a typo in a file they may never have edited.
//
// Electron-free and dependency-light on purpose: store.ts imports it from module scope.
