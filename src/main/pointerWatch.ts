// pointerWatch.ts — WHEN A CAPTURED WINDOW HAS TO BE TOLD THE POINTER LEFT (JOS-381).
//
// THE REPORT (owner, hands-on, 2026-08-16): "the unlock button on the overlay properly unshows
// itself when you mouse off normally, but when you have the operating system alt-tab menu open,
// and you mouse over the overlays while it's still open, mouse-off never fires and the unlock
// buttons stay open permanently until you mouse in again."
//
// WHY NOTHING IN THE WINDOW CAN NOTICE. A locked overlay is `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true,
// {forward:true})`: the forwarded moves ARE its hover sensor. The moment one of them reaches the
// header the renderer asks main to stop ignoring the mouse, and from then on the only things that
// can release the capture are a real leave reaching the window — a DOM `mouseleave`, a blur, a
// visibility change, or the last named reason letting go (renderer/overlay/pointerExit.ts, the
// three signals of JOS-358). With the Windows task switcher up, the switcher owns input: the
// forwarded move that CAPTURED still arrived, nothing arrives afterwards, and when the switcher
// closes the pointer is already somewhere else. So the window sits captured — chrome showing, and
// worse, NOT click-through over the game — until the pointer happens to come back and leave again.
//
// THE ANSWER IS ONE CHEAP QUESTION, ASKED ONLY WHILE IT MATTERS: is the cursor still inside the
// rectangle? This file is that question as a plain decision; `overlayPointerWatch.ts` is the half
// that knows about Electron, and it is the only caller.
//
// ================================ THE PERFORMANCE CONTRACT ================================
// The owner's standing rule (2026-08-16, the JOS-363..372 hitch program): "be careful with
// performance implications regarding the hover watchdog - we've done a lot of work to make it not
// hurt global mouse performance." Five rules, and they are the design rather than a caveat:
//
//   1. NOTHING TOUCHES THE MOUSE'S HOT PATH. No WH_MOUSE_LL, no hook of any kind, no change to
//      what forwards (replayGate.ts still decides that, unchanged). This watch never sits between
//      the system and a mouse event; it READS a coordinate on a timer, which is the opposite
//      arrangement.
//   2. THE TIMER EXISTS ONLY WHILE A LOCKED OVERLAY IS CAPTURED — seconds at a time, per window.
//      A locked-and-idle overlay, an unlocked one, a hidden one and a destroyed one all have
//      exactly zero timers (`overlayShouldWatch` below is that decision, and it is unit-tested).
//   3. ONE READ PER TICK. A tick is one cursor read plus four numeric comparisons against a
//      rectangle this module is HOLDING. `getBounds()` is not free either, so it is not on the
//      tick: the rectangle is read when the watch starts and re-read ONLY to confirm an apparent
//      exit (see `pointerWatchTick`), which happens at most once per capture.
//   4. ONE MESSAGE PER CAPTURE. The exit is sent once and the watch stops itself; nothing here
//      sends IPC, calls `setIgnoreMouseEvents`, or moves a window on a tick.
//   5. 200 ms, and never tighter than 150. The exit only has to beat a human noticing the chrome
//      is still up — five reads a captured second is already generous.
//
// ELECTRON-FREE ON PURPOSE — the same bargain topmost.ts and security.ts strike. The window and
// the cursor arrive as a structural PORT, so the whole policy is a plain module a node test can
// drive with fakes, and the Electron half hands it the real thing.

/**
 * Does this overlay need a watch at all?

 * THE WHOLE OF RULE 2, in one predicate, so "zero timers for a locked-and-idle overlay" is a
 * property a unit test can hold rather than a claim about a call graph:
 *
 *   - `locked` — an INTERACTIVE overlay owns the mouse outright and gets every real leave the
 *     window manager delivers. It has nothing to be rescued from, and polling for it would be a
 *     timer running for every window a user is dragging.
 *   - `captured` — the state this bug lives in, and the only one. Locked and idle means main is
 *     ignoring the mouse: there is no capture to release, so there is nothing to watch for.
 *   - `alive` — hidden or destroyed windows are nobody's hover target (`setOverlaysHidden`
 *     re-applies the locked mode on the way down, which is what stops the watch there).
