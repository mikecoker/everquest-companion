// ============================================================================
// perf.ts — the main-process half of performance profiling.
// ============================================================================
//
// Two independent things live here, and they are wired from the composition root
// (`src/main/index.ts`) the same way `startQueueFlush` and `startTelemetry` are:
//
//   THE HUD SAMPLER — `app.getAppMetrics()` every 2 s plus an event-loop lag probe every
//   500 ms, aggregated into one `PerfSample` pushed to the renderer. It runs ONLY while the
//   user's switch is on.
//
//   THE STARTUP PROFILE — eight phase marks, recorded on EVERY launch whether the HUD is on or
//   off, written once to `<userData>/perf-startup.json`.
//
// ============================== THE PERFORMANCE CONTRACT ==============================
// An instrument that costs something when it is off is a bug, not a feature. Concretely:
//
//   1. NOTHING RUNS WHEN THE HUD IS OFF. No interval is created — not a skipped one, not a
//      no-op one. With the default install (`perfHud.enabled: false`) this module's entire
//      runtime cost is the eight `markStartupPhase` calls below (an array push each) plus the two
//      always-on startup probes, which exist only between `appReady` and `replayDone` and are
//      described where they are started.
//   2. EVERY TIMER IS `unref`'d, so none of them can be the reason the process outlives its
//      windows.
//   3. THE PUSH IS ONE MESSAGE PER 2 s, and only while a renderer exists to receive it.
//   4. MARKING IS FREE, WHICH IS WHY IT IS UNCONDITIONAL. `performance.now()` plus a push is
//      microseconds; the launch you wish you had profiled is always the one that already
//      happened (plan P4), so there is no switch to forget to turn on.
//
// The pure half — aggregation, lag stats, severity, phase accounting, formatting — is
// `src/shared/perf.ts` and is pinned by `tests/perf.test.mts`. What is left here is I/O.
