// overlayBounds — WHERE AN OVERLAY WINDOW IS, HOW TALL IT IS, AND WHICH OF THAT IS WRITTEN DOWN.
// ============================================================================
//
// One subject, two rulings, and they only make sense beside each other:
//
//   JOS-187 — the store keeps the rectangle THE USER CHOSE; the screen gets the one that FITS.
//   JOS-386 — …except a con card's HEIGHT, which is never anybody's choice at all: it follows
//             the card, every time, and is derived rather than remembered.
//
// It is its own module because windows.ts is AT the repo's 400-code-line ceiling and this is the
// part of it that was never about Electron's window factory — it is a policy about persistence,
// with three `setBounds`-shaped lines at the bottom. Same split, and the same argument, as
// OVERLAY_TITLE moving to overlayLayout.ts (JOS-194) and the snap moving to overlaySnapDrag.ts.
// windows.ts HANDS this file each window as it is created; nothing here reaches back for a
// registry, so the dependency runs one way and there is no cycle to reason about.
//
// ---- JOS-187: WHAT IS SHOWN vs WHAT IS STORED -------------------------------------------------
//
// THE STORE KEEPS THE RECTANGLE THE USER CHOSE. THE SCREEN GETS THE ONE THAT FITS. That is the
// whole policy, and it is what makes a docking round trip lossless: undock the widescreen and the
// overlay is DRAWN on the laptop panel while `overlays.<kind>.bounds` still says "x: 2600, on the
// right-hand monitor"; plug the monitor back in and the same fit puts it back where it was, on the
// display the user actually put it on. Persisting the corrected rectangle instead would silently
// destroy that layout the first time a cable came out — and it would do it on a laptop screen the
// user may only be on for the length of a train journey.
//
// The mechanism is one remembered rectangle. Every rectangle the APP applies to a window itself is
// recorded here first, and the move handler refuses to persist the one it recognises as its own —
// so the only writes that reach the store are the user's own moves and resizes. The marker is
// dropped the moment a window reports any OTHER rectangle, so a user who later drags a window back
// onto that exact spot still has it saved. Deliberately not a timer or a re-entrancy flag: Electron
// may emit 'moved'/'resized' synchronously from `setBounds` or a tick later, and a policy that
// depended on which would be a policy that worked on one platform.
//
// A PIXEL OF SLACK, because `setBounds` is not always an identity: on a scaled display the value
// makes a round trip through physical pixels and can come back one off. The cost is that a 1px
// nudge in the instant after a re-placement is not persisted — which is not a position anyone is
// expressing — and it is paid only until the window next moves anywhere else.
//
// ---- JOS-386: THE WINDOW FITS THE CARD --------------------------------------------------------
//
// The con card was a 520x300 window whatever it drew, and the card is a few lines of chips and
// drops, so most of that window was an EMPTY APRON: invisible while the overlay is transparent, a
// dark box under the card in the JOS-40 opaque mode, and in BOTH modes a rectangle that captures
// the mouse for as long as a card is on screen.
//
// THREE PARTS, THREE PROCESSES, AND NONE OF THEM DOES TWO JOBS:
//
//   renderer/overlay/overlayFit.ts + ConCardOverlay — MEASURES what was drawn. It has to be the
//     renderer: the card's height is a layout result at whatever text scale the user chose, and
//     `getBoundingClientRect` is the only thing that can read it (it already carries the `zoom`
//     ScaledContent applies, so the measurement is in the same pixels a window is).
//   overlayLayout.ts `fittedOverlayHeight` — the POLICY. Pure, node-tested: the request, clamped
//     up to the floor every kind shares and down to the room below the window's TOP EDGE, so a
//     card too tall for the space under it SHRINKS and never slides the window up the screen.
//   this file — the WINDOW. It owns no geometry rule of its own; it applies one.
//
// AND THE HEIGHT NEVER REACHES THE STORE, which is where the two rulings meet:
//
//   * the fit's own resize goes through `applyOverlayBounds`, so it is marked as OURS and the move
//     handler below refuses to write it down — the JOS-187 mechanism, unchanged;
//   * and `storedOverlayBounds` strips the height from the rectangle that IS written down, so a
//     user's MOVE persists with the kind's default height. Otherwise one tall card would become
//     the size of every empty window from then on. What persists for a fit kind is position and
//     WIDTH; the height is re-derived on every card.
//
// ---- JOS-406: A STRIP'S STORED RECTANGLE IS A LAYOUT BOX, NOT A WINDOW ------------------------
//
// A third ruling, and it composes with both of the above rather than replacing either: for the
// three STRIPS — the toast, the alert banner and the con card, the kinds whose window IS the card —
// what is written down is the box AT 100% TEXT, and what reaches the screen is that box times the
// kind's effective text scale. The arithmetic (centre-preserving, work-area clamped) is
// `scaledStripBounds` / `stripLayoutBounds` in overlayLayout.ts, node-tested there; this file is
// where the three moments it applies live:
//
//   OPEN and DISPLAY-CHANGE — `overlayAppliedBounds` scales the stored layout on the way to a
//     window (windows.ts `overlayPlacement` / `reconcileOverlayDisplays`).
//   A TEXT-SIZE CHANGE — `refitStripsForTextScale`, from the two IPC routes that can move a scale
//     (ipc/windowControls.ts). Every open strip is re-placed through `applyOverlayBounds`, so the
//     move is marked as OURS and the handler below does not write it down as a drag.
//   A USER RESIZE — `storedOverlayBounds` divides it back out, so the box somebody drags at 150%
//     is remembered as the box it is at 100%.
//
// The two earlier rulings are untouched by it: the store still keeps what the user chose (it is
// now expressed at one fixed scale rather than at whatever the text happened to be), and a con
// card's height is still the card's — `stripLayoutBounds` leaves a fit kind's height alone and
// `storedOverlayBounds` then replaces it with the placeholder exactly as before.
