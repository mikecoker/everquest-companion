// LEVEL UNLOCKS, assembled — main's half of "what's new at this level"
// (docs/plans/levelup-whats-new.md, wave O2).
//
// NOTHING IS SCRAPED OR FETCHED HERE. Both halves are already committed and already bundled into
// the MAIN process (electron-vite inlines a JSON import — a path-relative read would miss in
// out/main/, the standing gotcha):
//   * spells.json  → the wiki's `classes` bullet list, parsed to (class, level) pairs by
//     shared/spellLevels.ts, plus the four card fields a hover needs.
//   * classes.json → `skillUnlocks` / `discUnlocks` / `disputed`, committed by wave O1.
// The renderer cannot import either (it must not reach into src/main), so this module folds them
// into the one shared wire shape and the panel pulls it once per session.
//
// THE DISPUTE RIDES ON THE ROW. classes.json states its disagreements as prose in `disputed[]`;
// a renderer that had to re-match those strings against rows would be re-deriving knowledge at
// the far end of an IPC. Instead every disputed discipline row carries the wiki's own sentence
// VERBATIM, so the panel's honesty chip is a field read, not an inference (law 1). Twelve rows
// today — BER 2, MNK 10 — the non-Rogue disciplines the central Disciplines page strikes through,
// less the one row a player has since CONFIRMED in game (`CONFIRMED_UNLOCKS`, below).
//
// CACHED FOREVER: both inputs are compile-time constants, so the fold runs once per process.

// server that has not opened Kunark. The verdict rides the row (`UnlockSpell.outOfEra`) rather than

 * whose table holds exactly one row (RNG) cannot distinguish "the wiki disputes this discipline"
 * from "the wiki disputes RNG disciplines in general". The chip nonetheless reads, to the player
 * looking at his own unlock, as doubt about the ability he is holding.
 *
 * THE EVIDENCE BAR IS `spellRemovalsList.ts`'s RULE 1, POINTING THE OTHER WAY. Absence and
 * presence are both unmeasurable from a log here — a discipline is trained, not cast, and the
 * client prints no line when one becomes available — so the only instrument is a person with the
 * game open, and the entry states WHO, WHEN and WHAT THEY SAW. A hypothesis about which
 * disciplines EQ Legends runs is NOT admissible: this clears one row and claims nothing about the
 * twelve BER/MNK rows beside it, which keep their chips until somebody looks at them too.
 *
 * AND THE SCRAPE STAYS PRISTINE. classes.json is rewritten wholesale by `npm run scrape:classes`,
 * so deleting the RNG sentence out of `disputed[]` by hand would come back on the next run and
 * would ALSO be a lie about what the wiki says — the wiki does still strike the table through.
 * The confirmation is an overlay applied at fold time, the arrangement `spellRemovals.ts` already
 * made for the spell scrape.
 *
 * `level` IS PART OF THE MATCH, NOT DECORATION: the confirmation is "this ability, at this level",
 * so a re-scrape that moves the row states something nobody has checked and the dispute comes
 * back rather than being silently cleared at a level no one confirmed.
