// WHAT THIS SPELL REPLACES, AND WHAT REPLACES IT (JOS-391).
//
// The reader for `spellLines.json` (written by `scripts/gen-spell-lines.ts` out of the thirteen
// spell-line research files - that script's header states every artefact it repairs on the way in).
// Bundled by IMPORT, never `readFileSync`, the law spellDb.ts's other data obeys.
//
// ONE QUESTION, ASKED PER CLASS. "Does Healing replace anything" has no answer on its own: the
// same name sits at a different rung for a cleric and a shaman, and a druid's Skin line is not a
// ranger's. So the index is keyed by /who code and the caller supplies the class the row is drawn
// for. A spell no line carries answers `{ null, null, null }` - most of the catalog, and the
// honest shape for it.
//
// A RANK IS NOT A LINE, and this file is the reason that distinction is now a data question rather
// than an argument. `SpellCard.tsx` used to draw "replaces <previous rank>" off the roman-numeral
// tail; the owner removed it (JOS-293) because ranks are orthogonal to upgrade lines on EQL and a
// player rarely drops the older rank. So names are matched WHOLE here - no rank stripping - and
// what a member replaces comes from the research's ordered list and nowhere else.
//
// ── THE ONE RULE THIS FILE OWNS: A REPLACEMENT IS STRICTLY EARLIER ──────────────────────────────
//
// The generator sorts and dedupes; it does not decide what "previous" means. Two members at the
// SAME level do not replace one another, and that is a real shape rather than a defect: the cleric
// Heroism line ends `Heroism@52` and `Heroic Bond@52`, the group version of the same buff, and the
// druid Skin line carries the single-target and group forms side by side. Saying "Heroic Bond
// replaces Heroism" would tell a player to stop memorizing a spell they still want. So `replaces`
// walks BACKWARD to the nearest member at a strictly LOWER level, and `replacedBy` forward to the
// nearest strictly HIGHER one; a same-level neighbour is skipped, not reported.
