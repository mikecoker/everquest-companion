// THE JOIN FROM A CATALOG SPELL NAME TO THE CLIENT'S HITPOINT SLOTS (JOS-396).
//
// Three lines of code and a page of reasons, which is the usual ratio for a join key in this repo.
//
// WHY IT IS A MODULE AND NOT AN INLINE LOOKUP. Two surfaces need it — the Leveling tab's unlock
// rows (`levelUnlocks.ts`) and the spell card (`spellDetail.ts`) — and law 2 says names are dirty
// and canonicalised at boundaries. Two call sites each writing their own `table[name.toLowerCase()]`
// is two opinions about what a spell's key is, and the wrong one fails SILENTLY: a spell that
// should have gained figures simply keeps showing none, which is the exact defect this ticket
// exists to fix. `spellCanonKey` is the key the client table was BUILT with (spellsUsParse.ts), so
// it is the only key that can read it back.
//
// WHY IT TAKES THE TABLE AS AN ARGUMENT rather than reaching for it. `src/main/resist/spellTable.ts`
// imports Electron, and both callers are pure node-tested modules (tests/levelUnlocks.test.mts,
// tests/spellDetailFacts.test.mts import them directly). The table is therefore threaded in from the
// IPC handler, which is already an Electron file — and that also buys the LAZINESS the ticket asks
// for for free: the handler reads `spellTableNow()` on every invoke, so a fold that happened before
// the worker resolved is rebuilt the first time somebody asks after it did, instead of baking a
// null into the dataset for the rest of the run.

/**
 * The client's facts for one catalog spell name, or undefined when there is nothing to add.
 *
 * Undefined for "no client install", "no row for this name", and a row that states neither
 * hitpoint slots nor a re-use timer — they are one answer to the caller (`spellMetricsAt` falls
 * back to nothing) and distinguishing them here would only invite a surface to say something about
 * a file the user may legitimately not have.
 *
 * THE ROW IS RETURNED WHOLE, which is what lets a field added to `SpellResistInfo` reach the reader
 * without a line of plumbing here — `ClientHpFacts` is the subset `shared/spellMetrics.ts` names.
 * JOS-444's `recastMs` arrives that way, and it is also why the gate above grew a second arm: a
 * spell whose WIKI page states the hitpoint line and omits the recast has no effect-0 slot to
 * qualify on, and the denominator of its sustained dps is exactly what the client row is for.
