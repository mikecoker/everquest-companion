// spellDetail.ts — BUILD the one-spell record the hover card draws (JOS-293).
//
// It is a JOIN and nothing else: the effective spell DB (spells.json + the corrections overlay,
// already applied by `loadSpellDb`), the derived effect classes (spellEffectClass.ts, the
// separable JOS-251 overlay), and the ranks the LOG has seen you cast. Nothing is computed that a
// source did not state - a field the wiki omits arrives here as `undefined` and leaves as
// `undefined`, which is what lets the card obey law 1 by construction rather than by discipline.
//
// WHY THE LOG IS IN HERE AT ALL. The DB knows one row per line for ~1,800 of its ~1,900 spells
// (shared/spellLines.ts states the measurement), so it cannot name `Celestial Remedy II` when you
// ask about `Celestial Remedy III`. The log can: `AlertsSnap.spellLastCast` is rank-PRESERVING and
// is recorded on replay as well as live. Joining them here - rather than in the renderer, which
// would make every host surface pass its own rank map in - is what makes the card the same card on
// every surface. Each member carries which source named it; see shared/spellDetail.ts for the
// boundary that arrangement is honest about.
