// defaultPacks.ts — the ONE voice pack the app ships with, defined once and shared by:
//   - scripts/fetch-packs.mts (dev: writes it into resources/soundpacks/ for a source
//     build), and
//   - src/main/provisionPacks.ts (runtime: silently installs it into
//     <userData>/soundpacks/ on startup when missing, so a CI-built installer — which
//     ships WITHOUT the gitignored audio — still has the sounds the seeded alerts need).
//
// WHY ONE PACK: the app used to self-provision the PeonPing og-packs `peon` +
// `sc_marine` packs and seed alerts against a synthesized `default` chime pack. Those
// read as robotic/joke defaults; the shipped default is now Alan Rickman — spoken-word
// lines that fit EverQuest's tone. The synthesized `default` pack is GONE (its
// generator + assets were deleted, Task #57); `peon`/`sc_marine` were never ours —
// they're still in the openpeon registry and installable from the in-app Sound Packs
// browser. Provisioning only ADDS what's missing and never removes a pack on disk.
//
// STABLE SOUND IDS: the pack is pinned to a release TAG, so its openpeon.json is
// immutable and the ids the shared CESP→manifest conversion derives (deriveSoundId:
// "<category-slug>-<file-slug>") are deterministic and identical whether the pack
// arrives via self-provisioning, `npm run fetch:packs`, or a user-initiated registry
// install. DEFAULT_ALERT_SOUNDS below are those derived ids; provisionPacks verifies
// they resolved after an install, so drift is caught in errors.log rather than silently
// muting an alert.

import type { AlertDef, AlertSoundRef, RegistryPack } from '../../shared/types'
// The curated one-click alert GROUPS live in shared/ (the renderer authors them and cannot

// changed still point at packs the app no longer ships (`default`, which no longer
// EXISTS anywhere, plus the `peon` / `sc_marine` / `bastion` packs the app used to
// provision or that a user tried out). store.ts runs the rewrite below exactly once per
// install (version-stamped) so an upgrading user's existing alerts land on the shipped
// pack instead of silently going mute when the old dir is gone.
//
// The rewrite is pack-wide and one-way: any ref into a legacy pack becomes an
// alan-rickman ref. Those packs stay installable from the in-app registry browser — a
// user who reinstalls one can re-point any alert at it, and this migration never runs
// again to undo that.

/**
 * Packs whose alert refs the one-time migration rewrites onto the shipped default.
 *
 * ADDING AN ID HERE POINTS EVERY UNSTAMPED USER'S ALERTS AWAY FROM THAT PACK, so the list is
 * pinned verbatim by tests/alertSoundMigrationPin.test.mts. In particular
 * `DEFAULT_ALERT_PACK_ID` may never appear in it: that would make the rewrite a rewrite of
 * itself and, paired with a version bump, would re-point every alert in the fleet.
