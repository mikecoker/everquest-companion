// Character-epoch detection (Task #49; ANCHOR REPLACED in Task #50).
//
// THE BETA-WIPE STORY (grep-able for future same-name+server cases). EQ Legends names its
// log file `eqlog_<Char>_<server>.txt` — so a character that is DELETED and RECREATED with
// the SAME name on the SAME server reuses the SAME log file. The user's real log:
//   • A BETA character leveled to 26 (Jul 19) then 30 (Jul 20).
//   • At launch that beta character was WIPED.
//   • The log CONTINUES in the same file: `Welcome to EverQuest Legends!` logins, then a
//     `You have gained a level! Welcome to level 2!` on Jul 28 12:32:09 (real line 172394),
//     re-leveling 2→3→…→26→44→50 as a fresh character.
// Everything before that boundary belongs to the DEAD beta character and CONTAMINATES every
// character-scoped tally: AA (dashboard read 219-220 allocated vs the in-game 206), loot,
// kills, turn-ins, and Plane-of-Sky quest completions. Integrator-verified post-boundary
// ground truth: AA allocated=206, unspent=1, Σ gains=207 — an EXACT in-game match with zero
// refund churn (the Jul-28 "respec" the earlier AA model saw was cross-epoch contamination,
// not a respec).
//
// THE DETECTION — anchored at the OFFICIAL LAUNCH, not a heuristic (Task #50, USER CORRECTION).
// The epoch fires once at the FIRST event whose timestamp is at/after the launch instant
// 2026-07-28 00:00 LOCAL. Everything before that instant is the dead beta character; the
// current character's life begins at launch. The first post-launch login on this log is
// Jul 28 12:21:25 and the first current-character level-up is 12:32 — both land on the
// correct side of the boundary. Pre-launch beta logs on OTHER servers are unaffected: the
// date anchor applies per-log, and any log with no post-launch event simply never fires
// (its whole span is one epoch), which is correct.
//
// WHY NOT the old LEVEL-REGRESSION trigger? It was UNSAFE. In EQ Legends, swapping LOADOUTS
// legitimately changes your character level ("when you switch loadouts, it uses the level of
// your loadout" — in-log chat evidence; there is NO explicit swap log line, verified), so a
// decisive downward level jump is NOT a reliable rebirth fingerprint — a loadout swap to a
// low-level loadout would falsely trip an epoch and wipe the current character's tallies. The
// launch DATE is the strictly better anchor the user mandated: it is unambiguous, needs no
// heuristic threshold, and can't be confused with in-game mechanics. The regression trigger
// is therefore REMOVED entirely (not merely disabled).
//
// WHY NOT the `Welcome to EverQuest Legends!` login line? It prints on EVERY login (14× in
// the real log — every session start), so it is NOT an epoch signal.
//
// SOURCES for the launch date (2026-07-28):
//   • massivelyop.com — EverQuest Legends launch coverage (Jul 28, 2026).
//   • monstervine.com — EverQuest Legends launch coverage (Jul 28, 2026).
//   • The user's own log corroborates: the launch-day login is Jul 28 12:21:25 and the first
//     current-character `Welcome to level 2!` is Jul 28 12:32:09.
//
// WHERE THIS RUNS. index.ts subscribes this to the bus alongside the other consumers and, at
// the first at/after-launch event, hands an `EpochEvent` back onto the SAME bus via
// emitDerived — the Task #47 derived-events path. The event is delivered to every consumer
// AFTER the current primary event finishes, so the modules see the event THEN reset. `live`
// is inherited from the primary event, so a replayed boundary stays live:false.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A BETA-EPOCH CUTOFF: RECOMMENDED, NOT IMPLEMENTED (JOS-185, 2026-08-10)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Recorded here rather than built, because it changes what every module sees and that is the
// owner's call. The report behind it is 01KZP9GH8HTFAQWYS6408SG781 (beta-era log poisoning Sky
// state); 01KZP6XM8WD1ERB5FF2VA03CJ3 (level wrong from late logging) is the same shape from the
// other end.
//
// WHAT IS WEAK TODAY. The whole log is folded, beta span included, and the contamination is then
// DELETED by a reset that every character-scoped module has to remember to subscribe to. That is
// cleanliness by convention: it is correct for the modules that do subscribe, silently wrong for
// any that do not, and a module written next year inherits nothing from this comment. The dead
// beta character's state is built in full before anything undoes it.
//
// THE RECOMMENDATION: make the cutoff a REGISTRY PROPERTY rather than a reset. Each module
// declares whether it is epoch-scoped; the registry then never DELIVERS a pre-`LAUNCH_MS` event
// to an epoch-scoped module, while the knowledge miners (mined spell durations, the message
// overlay — which persist across epochs on purpose) keep receiving the whole span. Three things
// fall out of it: contamination becomes structurally impossible instead of conventionally
// cleaned; a new module must STATE which side it is on before it can compile; and the fold gets
// cheaper for exactly the users this hurts, because a late logger's beta months stop being folded
// into state nobody keeps. The reset event stays — a character switch still needs it.
//
// TWO THINGS NOT TO DO. Do not drop pre-launch lines at the scan/tailer level: that starves the
// knowledge miners, which is the one thing the current design gets right, and the evidence is
// gone rather than merely unread. And do not move `LAUNCH_MS` off LOCAL time to "tidy" it —
// the anchor and the parser are deliberately on one clock (see the constant's own note).
