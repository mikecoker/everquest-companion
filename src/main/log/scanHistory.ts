/**
 * Split ONE chunk into complete lines, handing each to `handle`, and carry the trailing

 * accounting lives in one place.
 *
 * NOTHING IS DECODED UNTIL ITS TERMINATING NEWLINE IS IN HAND (JOS-373), and the hazard that
 * bought that rule is not theoretical. This carry used to be DECODED TEXT: the trailing partial
 * line was run through `toString('utf8')` at the end of every chunk and string-concatenated onto
 * the head of the next one. A read chunk boundary falls at a fixed byte count (READ_CHUNK_BYTES)
 * and lands wherever it lands — mid-line, and just as easily mid-CHARACTER. Decoding half of a
 * multi-byte sequence yields U+FFFD, decoding the other half yields another, and the character is
 * destroyed permanently: the two halves can never be rejoined once the decoder has replaced them.
 * The byte accounting stayed correct throughout, so nothing downstream ever noticed — it is the
 * NAME on the line that is wrong, on a log with one chance per megabyte to be wrong. The live tail
 * had the same bug against its own slice boundary and fixed it first (Tailer.ts `consume`); this is
 * that shape, ported.
 *
 * SO: split on the newline BYTE, decode each line exactly once, whole. The carry is joined to the
 * next chunk's head AT LINE COMPLETION rather than by concatenating it onto the whole chunk — the
 * chunk is a megabyte and the carry is one log line, so the cheap direction is obvious: at most one
 * small `Buffer.concat` per chunk (the carry is cleared by the chunk's first newline and never
 * re-armed until its last), versus a 1 MB copy per chunk. A carry LIST would only pay off for a
 * partial line spanning several chunks, i.e. a single log line over a megabyte long, which is not a
 * shape EverQuest produces.
 *
 * CHUNKED (docs/plans/chunked-replay.md §1): the yield lives HERE, per line, not per read chunk.
 * A 1 MB chunk is ~75 ms of folding on a real log — measured, and four times the whole slice
 * budget — so a scheduler that could only pause between chunks could not honour a 12 ms budget
 * at all. The check happens AFTER the line is folded, so a single monster event overshoots the
 * budget and then yields, rather than being split (it cannot be split) or skipped.
 *
 * The byte accounting, the order and the `handle` calls are byte-for-byte what they were, which is
 * what lets the equivalence test compare the two arms byte for byte.
 *
 * EXPORTED FOR THE BOUNDARY TEST (JOS-373) — the real function, not a copy of it. The hazard is a
 * split at one exact byte INSIDE a multi-byte character, and the only way to put a boundary there
 * deterministically is to hand the splitter the two halves as separate buffers: a read stream can
 * be asked for a chunk size, never made to promise one. The end-to-end arm at the real
 * READ_CHUNK_BYTES runs beside it; neither covers the other.

 * hand-synced pipelines.
 *
 * Streaming (FIX 2): reads via a byte stream with a chunk-based line splitter and
 * yields to the event loop periodically, so the Electron main process is never
 * blocked for the multi-second duration of a 68MB scan. Events are emitted in
 * strict file order.
 *
 * COOPERATIVELY SCHEDULED (docs/plans/chunked-replay.md §1): "periodically" used to mean "between
 * read chunks", which measured at 75 ms of main-loop stall per chunk. It now means "every
 * REPLAY_SLICE_MS of folding", which bounds the block directly — and, since JOS-50, each of those
 * pauses is a real REST rather than a `setImmediate`, so the fold cannot hold a core flat out for
 * the length of a replay either. See replaySlicer.ts for both constants and the measurements
 * behind them.
 *
 * Bounded (FIX 1): captures the file size S up front, processes only bytes [0, S),
 * and returns `endOffset` = the byte offset of the end of the last complete line
 * at or before S. The caller hands this to the tailer as its start offset for a
 * gapless handoff.
 *
 * THE LIVE HANDOFF IS UNAFFECTED BY SLICING, and this is the property that makes chunking safe.
 * There is no buffer-then-drain anywhere in this app: the scan reads to a FROZEN EOF (the size
 * captured above, before the first byte is read) and returns the byte offset of the last complete
 * line it consumed; session.ts then starts the Tailer AT that offset. Lines the game appends while
 * the scan runs land past S, are never read here, and are read by the tailer as its first bytes.
 * So a longer wall-clock scan simply means more bytes waiting for the tailer — never a line folded
 * twice, never one skipped, whatever the slice budget is.
