// CLASS-EVIDENCE families of the parse cascade (see parser.ts for the ordered list):
// the character's own `/who` row, the skill-up tick, and (Wave 3) the item-activation line.
// docs/plans/class-combo-inference.md — the lines the combo model needs that nothing
// else on the bus can supply.
//
// The third one is EVIDENCE ABOUT EVIDENCE: `Your <item> shimmers briefly.` is immediately
// followed by a `You begin casting …` line that the ITEM cast, not the player, so it is what
// lets the combo module tell a hand-cast from a clicky. Wave 1 measured that the design's
// sustain>=2 rule does not survive without it (post-swap ENC keeps 7 exclusive labels through
// clickies alone). See ItemActivateEvent in shared/logEvents.ts.
//
// Why its own module rather than a branch of parseCasts/parseWorld: neither line is a cast
// and neither is progression state. A `/who` row is a STATEMENT ABOUT THE CHARACTER (the
// only one the game ever prints — EQ Legends runs up to three classes at once and never
// logs a loadout swap), and a skill-up is the only signal that can see the four classes with
// no spell list at all. Keeping them together keeps the self-name guard — the thing that
// separates the player's row from the 410 strangers' rows in the same grammar — in one place.
//
// WHAT EACH RULE TAKES IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED — a full-log replay through the pre-change
// parser (spell DB installed, exactly as pipeline.ts wires it), diffed kind by kind:
//   `/who`        421 rows, ALL previously `{kind:'unknown'}`.
//   skill-up      10,216 lines, ALL previously `{kind:'unknown'}`.
//   itemActivate  7,921 lines: 7,749 previously `unknown` and 172 previously `spellEmote` —
//                 the `Your Idol of the Underking feels alive with power.` variant, whose
//                 missing ` (Exaltation)` let the permissive emote matcher read "Your Idol of
//                 the Underking" as a subject. 37 of the 39 other event kinds came out
//                 byte-identical, and a full-log BuffsModule replay differs in exactly one
//                 place: the observed-message miner no longer learns that line as a landing
//                 message for Superior Healing. It was never one — it is the item that fired
//                 the heal — so claiming it here is a correction, not a regression.

 *   `(?:\* RIP \*\s*)?` — the corpse variant, which prints `* RIP *` flush against the `[`.
 *   `(?:AFK\s+)?`       — the away marker.
 *   `\[(\d+) (CODES)\]` — the level + the slash-joined three-letter class codes. `[ANONYMOUS]`
 *                         states no classes and deliberately does NOT match.
 *   `(.+?)`             — the character name (a corpse row appends `'s corpse`).

 *                         evidence, so a row without it must still parse.
 *   `(?: <([^>]*)>)?`   — the guild tag. Captured only so it can't be eaten by the name.
