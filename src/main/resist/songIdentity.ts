// WHICH SPELLS ARE SONGS, AND WHICH SONG A LANDING SENTENCE BELONGS TO (JOS-382, round 2).
//
// Pure over an injected spell catalog. `tests/resistSongs.test.mts` drives it directly.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: THE BUG IT IS THE FIX FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The first cut decided "is this a song" from the log's own `You begin singing` line. That is a
// perfectly good signal and it is almost never printed: EQ Legends bards run their songs under the
// SYMPHONIC AURA, which re-pulses every six seconds with NO cast line at all. The owner's
// 2,013,829-line log contains FIVE `You begin singing` lines and 4,152 pulses of one song's
// landing emote. So nothing was ever flagged as a song, no cast was ever armed for the emote to
// join to, and every one of the 400 Largo's resists in the shipped baseline was filed as an
// ordinary cast with ZERO landings beside it. A spell that is 100% resisted by construction drags
// magic toward "nearly immune" on every mob a bard ever sang at.
//
// THE FIX IS TO DECIDE IT FROM SPELL IDENTITY. A spell only the Bard can learn is a song, always,
// whether or not the log announced it — and `spells.json` states the class outright
// (`"* Bard - Level 20"`). The parser's `sung` flag stays as a corroborating signal for the rare
// song a bard actually starts by hand.
//
// ── AND WHERE THE WIKI IS WRONG, THIS FILE NO LONGER SAYS SO (JOS-384) ──────────────────────────
//
// Round 2 shipped a `SONG_FAMILY_OVERRIDES` table here, one row wide: it pooled Largo's Assonant
// Binding (bard 51) into Largo's Melodic Binding (bard 20), because the catalog files the sentence
// EQ Legends prints for the level-20 song under the level-51 one. The measurement was right and
// the PLACE was wrong. Owner ruling 2026-08-16: a correction to wiki data is APP-WIDE or it is
// nothing — a module-local one leaves the buff overlay, the alerts and the timers reading a catalog
// the resist page has already decided is wrong, which is two different answers to one question.
//
// So the row moved, with its evidence, to `src/main/data/spellCorrectionsList.ts` (search Largo),
// where it is applied at load in `spellDb.ts` and every consumer sees it. This file consumes the
// corrected catalog like any other, and carries no sentence and no spell name of its own —
// `tests/largoBinding.test.mts` is the guard that keeps it that way for every feature module.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS HERE, stated because it is a real behaviour change and not a refactor: the
// corrected sentence now has TWO owners, so the emote arrives with two candidates and
// `resolveSongEmote` has to separate them from the log instead of from a table. It does that the
// way it already did for `<mob> winces.` — against the songs a resist line has NAMED — which is
// evidence rather than a claim, and which is silent until the log has named one.

 * resist lines.
 *
 * `named` is every song key a resist line has spelled out, best first (this mob, then anywhere in

 * REFUSED rather than guessed at, because pooling two songs would smear their resist adjusts
 * together and a -100 proc adjust is exactly the thing this model exists to take out.
 *
 * THE ORDER OF THE TWO NARROWINGS IS NOT ARBITRARY. `named` is the stronger evidence and would be
 * first if it were always THERE — but it is a running tally, so it says nothing about the pulses
 * before the log first spelled the song out, and on the owner's log that is 35 landings (measured:
 * the first `bound by strands` emote is line 27,355 and the first `resisted your Largo's Melodic
 * Binding!` is line 30,098). The level is known from the first `/who` and does not move, so it is
 * what covers the opening of a session; `named` then decides everything the level cannot.
