// THE FOLD: log events in, pooled observations out (JOS-382).
//
// No Electron. `tests/resistFold.test.mts` drives it over committed fixtures cut from the owner's
// log, and `scripts/gen-resist-baseline.ts` drives the same class to mine the shipped baseline —
// one implementation, so what ships and what a user's own log produces cannot drift.
//
// ── IT NEVER READS THE CLIENT'S SPELL TABLE, AND THAT IS A DESIGN DECISION ───────────────────────
//
// `spells_us.txt` knows a spell's resist axis, its resist adjust and its level caps. This fold
// knows none of them, on purpose: everything it writes is something the LOG printed, so the ledger
// is meaningful without a file we are not allowed to redistribute, a shipped baseline is a
// table-independent artifact, and a game patch that retunes a spell costs a re-ESTIMATE rather
// than a re-fold of every log the user has ever tailed. Two exclusions the brief asks for
// therefore live in the estimator instead, which is where the facts are: rows for spells with no
// resist axis, and resists of a spell whose hard level cap the mob is above. The observable result
// is identical (neither reaches a number); the cost is a slightly larger baseline file, and the
// gain is that the fold has no dependency that can be missing.
//
// The two things it DOES consult are both already in this repo: the committed mob catalog (for a
// mob's level when `/con` has not stated one) and the wiki spell catalog (to recognise a resist
// debuff by its verbatim effect line).
//
// ── HOW EACH OUTCOME IS EARNED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   RESIST   `<mob> resisted your <Spell>!` — the game saying it flatly. Incoming resists
//            (`You resist <mob>'s <Spell>!`) are YOURS and out of scope entirely.
//   DAMAGE   `X hit <mob> for N points of <type> damage by <Spell>.` — the number goes into the
//            row's histogram, from which the estimator later derives full-versus-partial. A
//            CRITICAL is counted as a landing and kept OUT of the histogram: its number is not the
//            spell's full damage, and letting it in would invent a second "full" value.
//   LAND     the first tick of a DoT after its cast, and a cast-on-other emote joined back to your
//            own `You begin casting` — but never both for one spell on one mob, because a spell
//            that both emotes and prints damage produced ONE roll. The emote's landing is
//            therefore DEFERRED and cancelled by any damage line that follows it for the same mob
//            and spell, which is the log-only way of saying what the brief says with the client
//            table ("all-or-nothing spells only").
//   SONG     A SONG IS DECIDED BY SPELL IDENTITY, NEVER BY A BEGIN LINE (songIdentity.ts states
//            why at length: EQ Legends bards run under the Symphonic Aura, which re-pulses every
//            six seconds and prints no cast line, so the owner's two-million-line log carries five
//            `You begin singing` lines against 4,152 pulses of one song's landing emote). A spell
//            only the Bard can learn is a song, and a song is NEVER filed as a cast.
//
//            For a song whose landing sentence the catalog knows, the denominator is EXACT and
//            needs no reconstruction at all: every pulse that lands prints the sentence, every
//            pulse that does not prints a resist, so attempts = lands + resists per (song, mob).
//            The pulse machinery in songs.ts is reserved for songs with NO usable landing
//            sentence, where the only witnesses are resist lines, DoT ticks and the aura's own
//            heartbeat.
//
// ── ANOTHER PLAYER'S CASTS ARE RECORDED, AND NEVER ESTIMATED FROM ───────────────────────────────
//
// The owner's ruling admits `self` and `pc` casters. A stranger's damage lines and resists both
// print, so both are filed — but nothing in this app's inputs states another player's LEVEL (the
// parser reads a `/who` row only for the tailed character), and without a level there is no
// `levelMod` and therefore no rc. Those rows are evidence a drilldown can show and the estimator
// deliberately drops (`droppedNoLevel`). Filing them costs a little of the baseline's size and
// buys the per-spell evidence for spells the tailed character does not cast.
//
// ── AND SO ARE NPC CASTERS, WITH A LEVEL THIS TIME (JOS-385) ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Charmed pets and ordinary NPC casters are the third kind. Two things make them different from a
// stranger's casts, and both are why the owner asked for them:
//
//   THEIR LEVEL IS KNOWN. The committed catalog states it (a range folds to its midpoint) and a
//   `/con` of that mob this session beats it — the same ladder the TARGET's level already climbs.
//   So an npc row usually carries both levels and therefore an rc, which a `pc` row never can.
//   Where nothing states one it is null and the estimator drops the row, no special case.
//
//   THEIR SPELLS ARE ORDINARY ROWS in the client's table. `Lava Breath`, `Choking` and
//   `Dry Bone Fire Burst` sit in `spells_us.txt` with a resist type and a resist adjust like any
//   other spell, so the estimate joins them exactly as it joins yours. Nothing here reads that
//   file — see the block at the top — the join happens once, at estimate time.
//
// WHAT THEY DO **NOT** GET, deliberately: an armed cast. `onOtherCast` still arms `pc` casts only,
// so an npc's emote-only landing is never claimed. Two reasons, and the first is enough: the log
// carries 45k third-party cast-begins against 25k of yours, and arming all of them would put the
// fold's join window in contention on every landing sentence YOU earned. The second is that an
// npc's all-or-nothing spell then shows resists with no landings, which the estimator's own
// blindness guard already recognises and holds out of the number (`landingsNotObservable`) rather
// than reading as a 100%-resistant mob.
//
// ── A ROW'S TARGET HAS TO BE A CREATURE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `isMobTarget` (world.ts, which carries the argument) gates EVERY filing — the resist arm, the
// damage arm, the emote arm and the song sink. It is new here (JOS-385) even though it fixes
// something older: R is a statement about a creature, and while only players could cast, nothing
// ever checked that the thing being cast ON was one. The shipped JOS-382 baseline shows the cost —
// rows keyed `you` (Cannibalization damages its own caster), rows keyed on groupmates (a Superior
// Healing landing, and Jonthan's Provocation pulsing on five of them), ~2,700 observations under 56
// keys that are people's names, in a file this repo publishes. NPC casters would have made it a
// flood, because mobs cast on the player's group constantly.
