// The client resist table: load it once per app run, cache it by the source file's identity.
//
// TWO LAWS ARE BEING OBEYED HERE AT ONCE.
//
//   JOS-371 — nothing multi-megabyte and synchronous happens on the thread that tails the log.
//     The parse runs on `resistTableWorker.js`, a second rollup input beside index.js, and the
//     caller gets a promise. Until it resolves the app is in a well-defined state that the UI can
//     say out loud ("reading spell data"), never a stall.
//
//   JOS-208 — only redo work when the source changed. The parsed table is written to
//     `<userData>/spell-resist-cache.json` keyed by the SIZE and MTIME of the file it came from.
//     A launch where the player has not patched EverQuest reads a ~1 MB cache instead of a 38 MB
//     original; a launch after a patch finds the key stale, re-parses, and rewrites. The key is
//     deliberately not a hash: hashing 38 MB costs most of what parsing it costs.
//
// AND ONE THING IT REFUSES TO DO: crash when the file is not there. `EQ_LOG_PATH`-style overrides
// let a user point this app at a folder of logs with no EverQuest install behind it, and a Wine
// or trimmed install may lack the file. `spellTable()` then resolves to null, `spellDataAvailable`
// on every profile goes false, and the mob page says so instead of showing an empty card.

 *   1  JOS-382, the original table.
 *   2  JOS-396 — every effect-0 slot and the client's duration statement (`hp`, `hpDuration`). A
 *      version-1 cache is not upgradeable in place: the fields were never read out of the file, so
 *      the only way to get them is the re-parse this bump forces. It costs one launch's worth of
 *      worker time per install, once.
 *   3  JOS-444 - the re-use timer (`recastMs`, field 10). The same argument as 2: a version-2
 *      cache was written before anything read that column, so the field can only come from a
 *      re-parse, and a sustained dps with a missing denominator is a wrong number rather than an
 *      absent one.
