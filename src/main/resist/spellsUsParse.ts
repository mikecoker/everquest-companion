// spells_us.txt -> the resist table (JOS-382).
//
// Pure over a string: no Electron, no node, no worker. `tests/spellsUsParse.test.mts` drives it
// with hand-authored rows so the field map below is pinned by something other than a comment.
//
// WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM, AND WHY IT IS NEVER COMMITTED. The wiki-scraped `spells.json` this
// repo ships knows what a spell's messages are and nothing about how it is resisted — no resist
// type, no resist adjust. The client install has both: `<eqRoot>/spells_us.txt`, 38 MB, caret
// delimited, 73,963 rows including the Legends-only 74xxx ids (Smiting Strike, Scorching Arrow)
// that no wiki has. It is Daybreak's file. We read the player's own copy at runtime and never
// redistribute it or anything derived from it, which is also why the ledger stores observations
// rather than conclusions: nothing on disk in this repo needs the table to be meaningful.
//
// THE FIELD MAP, verified by measurement against the owner's install (2026-08-16):
//
//   0    spell id                       1    name
//   8    cast time, ms                  10   recast (re-use) time, ms (JOS-444)
//   11   buff duration formula (JOS-396) 12  buff duration
//   29   resist type (see axisFromResistType)
//   30   target type                    36..51  class levels, WAR..BER (255 = cannot use)
//   78   resist adjust                  172  effect slots, `$`-separated
//
// FIELD 10 IS THE RECAST AND FIELD 9 IS NOT, which is the only trap in that line and is measured
// rather than reasoned (owner's install, 2026-08-22). Field 9 is the RECOVERY time — the cooldown
// the game charges for any cast — and it reads 1500 on 18,008 of the 33,952 rows a class can cast,
// 0 on most of the rest; it disagrees with field 10 on 14,535 of them, so the two are plainly not
// one number written twice. WHICH of them is the re-use timer is settled by cross-checking against
// the wiki's own `recast_time` for the same spell: Odium (id 4093) reads 9 = 1500, 10 = 6000 and
// its page says 6 seconds; Garrison's Mighty Mana Shock (2552) reads 1500 in both and its page
// says 1.5; Complete Heal (1292) reads 9 = 1500, 10 = 0. Only field 10 tracks the page.
//
// FIELDS 11 AND 12 WERE ADDED BY JOS-396 and are measured the same way: Odium (id 4093) reads
// `11 = 7`, `12 = 5`, and formula 7 is "as many ticks as the caster's level, capped at field 12" —
// five ticks, thirty seconds, which is the duration the wiki's own page for Odium states and the
// duration the in-game spell window prints. `clientDurationTicks` (shared/spellMetrics.ts) holds
// the formula table and the measurement behind it.
//
// AND ONE CORRECTION TO THE BRIEF, because it was measured rather than assumed: an effect slot is
// `slot | effectId | base | limit | CALC | MAX`, not `… | max | calc`. The proof is Tashani
// (`2|50|-10|0|101|23`): Torven's table says Tashani is -23 magic resist, calc 101 is
// "base + level/2, capped", and 23 is the cap — read the other way round the formula code would
// be 23, which is not a formula, and the cap would be 101, which is not a number Tashani has ever
// produced. Malaisement (`…|-20|0|101|40`) confirms it at -40 all four, and Mesmerization
// (`1|31|2|0|100|55`) puts its documented "up to level 55" in the same position.
//
// EFFECT IDS THIS FILE CARES ABOUT: 0 hitpoints (the damage slot, which decides fixed vs
// variable), 46 fire / 47 cold / 48 poison / 49 disease / 50 magic / 111 all (the tash and malo
// family), 22 charm and 31 mesmerize (the two that carry a hard level cap).
