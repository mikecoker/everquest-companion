// EVERYTHING THE FOLD DOES ABOUT SONGS, in one place (JOS-382, round 2).
//
// Split out of `fold.ts` when that file crossed the repo's 400-code-line factoring ceiling. The
// seam is not arbitrary: songs are the one evidence family whose observations are earned
// differently from every other line the fold reads, and keeping the difference in one file is what
// lets `songs are excluded from R in ONE place` (owner ruling) stay literally true.
//
// ── HOW A SONG'S ATTEMPTS ARE COUNTED, and why there are two ways ───────────────────────────────
//
// EQ Legends bards run their songs under the SYMPHONIC AURA, which re-pulses every six seconds and
// prints NO cast line at all. So there is never anything to arm and never anything to join a
// landing emote to. What the log does print, per pulse, is one line per creature in range:
//
//     [16:29:32] Your feet move faster.                                   <- the aura's heartbeat
//     [16:29:32] Soldier of V`Zher resisted your Largo's Melodic Binding!  <- a pulse that missed
//     [16:29:32] Baron Telyx V`Zher is bound by strands of solid music.    <- a pulse that landed
//
//   1. THE SENTENCE IS KNOWN (the ordinary case). Every pulse that lands prints the song's
//      cast-on-other sentence and every pulse that misses prints a resist, so attempts are
//      lands + resists per (song, mob) EXACTLY. Nothing is reconstructed, and the pulse rules in
//      songs.ts are deliberately NOT applied on top: they would count the same pulses twice.
//   2. THE SENTENCE IS NOT KNOWN. Only then does the reconstruction run, on the witnesses there
//      are — resist lines, DoT ticks, and the aura's own heartbeat.
//
// ── AND ANOTHER BARD'S SONGS ARE NOT OURS TO READ ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A stranger's pulses print a landing sentence that names no caster, so their songs have no
// denominator we could ever see. Filing the resist half alone is exactly the defect this round
// fixes; refusing the whole spell is the honest half.
