// main/wine.ts — the ten lines that hand `shared/wineDetect.ts` a real machine (JOS-31).
//
// The detection itself is pure and lives in shared/ with an injected probe, so it can be tested
// from an env fixture on a Windows box that is not the thing it describes. This file supplies
// `process` and `fs` and does one other job: it ANSWERS ONCE.
//
// WHY IT IS CACHED. The answer cannot change while the process runs — you do not move a running
// process into a Wine prefix — and it is asked from three places with very different timing: the
// composition root's MODULE SCOPE (before Electron is ready, deciding hardware acceleration), the
// window factory (every time an overlay is opened), and an IPC handler (whenever Preferences is
// shown). Re-probing the filesystem on every overlay open would be a syscall for a constant.
//
// AND IT NEVER THROWS. `existsSync` does not throw for a missing file, but it can for a path the
// OS refuses outright, and this runs before the app has a window to complain in. A probe that
// fails is read as "not Wine" — the answer that changes nothing about how the app draws — with a
// line in errors.log naming what happened.
