//
// "Can the app save window size" (report 01KZSYHKZDERT9P4YAFJN4N3QP, v0.22.0). It half could: a
// rectangle was persisted under `windowBounds` and re-applied at creation, but three things were
// missing and each of them is a state the user expressed and the app forgot.
//
//   1. MAXIMIZED WAS NOT REMEMBERED — and worse, it was the one state that was actively DROPPED.
//      The old saver skipped the write while `isMaximized()`, which is right about the RECTANGLE
//      (a maximized window's bounds are the screen, and restoring to them next launch would leave
//      a window that looks maximized, isn't, and cannot be un-maximized back to anything the user
//      chose) and wrong about the fact. So a user who works maximized — which the frameless title
//      bar's double-click makes a one-gesture habit (JOS-204) — re-maximized the window on every
//      single launch. Both halves are now kept, because Electron already separates them:
//      `getNormalBounds()` IS the rectangle a restore would return to, at any moment, whatever the
//      window is doing. There is nothing to reconstruct and no second copy to keep in step.
//   2. THE WRITE WAS UNDEBOUNCED. `moved`/`resized` are end-of-gesture events on Windows, so this
//      was cheap in practice — but it is a synchronous JSON write to disk on an event the window
//      manager owns the frequency of, and a platform that emits them continuously (or a future
//      `resize`-driven caller) turns a drag into a write storm. A trailing debounce says the same
//      thing once.
//   3. NOTHING WAS WRITTEN ON QUIT. `close` was covered; `app.quit()` — the auto-updater's
//      `quitAndInstall`, an OS logoff — is NOT a window close, and Electron does not emit
//      `window-all-closed` on that path (appWindow.mts measured that for the e2e harness). So the
//      launch right after an update came up at whatever the last drag happened to have flushed.
//
// PURE ON PURPOSE, like `displayFit.ts` beside it: nothing here imports Electron. The window is
// taken as the four methods this file actually calls, so tests/windowState.test.mts can describe a
// maximized window, a minimized one and a destroyed one in a few lines — and the debounce is armed
// through an injected timer, so its test asserts the COALESCING rather than waiting on a clock
// (AGENTS.md: a main-process setTimeout snaps to the 15.6 ms tick grid, so a timing-based test of a
// debounce would be measuring Windows).
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE. Where the remembered rectangle may go on the screens that exist NOW is
// `displayFit.ts` + `windowPlacement.ts` (JOS-187), unchanged and shared with the overlays; this
// file never decides placement. The one policy the two share is stated at `sameWindowState`'s call
// site in windows.ts: THE STORE KEEPS THE RECTANGLE THE USER CHOSE, and the screen gets the one
// that fits.
