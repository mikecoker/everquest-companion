  // Same door, one flag: "what does the spell DB say" is this channel's question, and
  // `{unlocks:true}` asks the other half of it — the (class, level) unlock rows the Leveling
  // tab's "New at this level" panel draws, joined with classes.json's skill/disc/innate tables.
  // It rides the catalog channel because shared/ipc.ts was owned by a concurrent wave the day
  // this shipped (src/main/data/levelUnlocks.ts says so at the seam); the flag is VALIDATED, not
  // trusted, like every other renderer-supplied argument at a handler. A bare invoke — the

  // ---- ONE spell, in full (JOS-293: the rich spell card) ----
  // The deep read behind the hover card: every field the committed DB states for this name, the
  // effect classes derived from its effect list, and the ranks of its line that a source names.
  //
  // THE RANKS COME FROM THE ALERTS MODULE, and that is the whole reason this handler is not a pure
  // function of the DB. `AlertsSnap.spellLastCast` is the only rank-PRESERVING record in the app
  // (the buffs model's keys are rank-folded), and the DB holds a single row for ~1,800 of its
  // ~1,900 lines - so without it the card could never name the rank a spell replaces. Read
  // exactly the way the catalog reads the buffs snapshot above: off the registry, never mutated,
  // and an absent module simply means no observed ranks.
  //
  // The argument is a renderer string, so it is VALIDATED rather than trusted: anything that is
  // not a string is answered with the same not-found record an unknown spell gets.
  // AND THE MOTE RANK COMES FROM THE OBSERVED-RANK MODULE (JOS-447), read off the registry the same
  // way. It is a SECOND rank source beside `spellLastCast` on purpose and they answer different
  // questions: the alerts map names the rank display strings a lineage can list, while JOS-446's
  // fold answers "the highest rank this character holds" over merges as well as casts - which is
  // the number the `yours: VIII` pill already states, and therefore the number the at-rank figures
  // beside it have to be read at, or the card would contradict itself.
