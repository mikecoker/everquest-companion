// inventory/parseInventory.ts — the FLAT held-counts view, now a facade over the engine.
// ============================================================================
//
// This module used to be the whole inventory story: a line-at-a-time reader that threw
// away everything except "name → how many". The general `/outputfile` engine
// (`src/main/outputs/`) now parses the dump into the deep model, and this file derives the
// same flat map from it.
//
// `parseInventoryText` returns the `HeldCounts` map the old reader returned — the derivation
// rule is written out on `heldCountsFromDump` (shared/outputs/inventory.ts) and pinned against
// the real 295-line dump in tests/outputsInventory.test.mts, which replays the OLD algorithm
// and diffs it key-for-key. The refactor that created this facade changed nothing; JOS-66 then
// made ONE deliberate change, and the test states it as a measured difference rather than
// regenerating the oracle: a `KeyRing` row in a held category (today: `Equipment`) now counts,
// because that table is a storage location holding real copies and a reporter's Plane of Sky
// quest items live there and nowhere else. Everything about the `Location` table is unchanged.
//
// A caller that wants the deep model (sockets, bags, bank, keyring, tiers) imports
// `loadInventoryDump` from `../outputs` instead. This flat view is not the substrate; it is
// one derived projection of it.

/**
 * The active character's newest dump, as held counts, WITH the instant it was generated.
 *
 * ONE READ PATH (JOS-44). This used to do its own find + readFile + stat beside the engine's;
 * now it is `loadInventoryDump` (the registry's find + mtime + parse) with the compatibility
 * derivation applied on top, so "which file" and "how old" can never disagree with what the
 * Exaltations tab and the freshness line are saying. Byte-identical by construction:
 * `heldCountsFromDump` is exactly what `inventoryHeldCounts` applies to the same parsed dump.
 *
 * THE GENERATION INSTANT (JOS-128) is resolved here, at the one place a dump becomes the model,
 * and persisted beside the counts. `writtenAt` is INJECTED rather than imported: the log's export
 * receipts live in a module behind the pipeline, and this file is the fs/parse layer that tests
 * drive without one. Omit it and it falls back to mtime, which is the same answer a log with no
 * receipt gives.
 *
 * AND THE READ INSTANT (JOS-253) is stamped here too, because this is the one place a dump becomes
 * the model. `now` is injected for the same reason `writtenAt` is — a test that pins the record
 * should not have to pin a clock — and defaults to `Date.now`.
 *
 * IT IS A RECORD, NOT A RESET (JOS-141). The instant used to be the point the held-count model
 * reset to and accumulated from; the owner reverted that on 2026-08-09, because a dump only
 * covers what was open when it was written and the reset was eating banked Sky items. Nothing in
 * the counting path reads `generatedAt` or `storagesCovered` any more (the combination rule is
 * renderer/features/inventory/reconcile.ts, and it is fully additive). They are still written
 * because they are true, cheap, and the honest answer to how old this dump is.
