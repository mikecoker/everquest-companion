// ============================================================================
//
// THE COUNTER TABLES CANNOT ANSWER THIS, and no amount of arithmetic over them will: `usage_daily`
// is keyed on a DAY, and "right now" is not a day. The only live signal this platform has is the
// EMF metric the ingest Lambda emits per accepted batch — `EQCompanion/Telemetry · Heartbeats`,
// dimension `Channel=prod` — where one heartbeat is one open session per HEARTBEAT PERIOD. The Sum
// over a period of exactly that length therefore IS the number of sessions that were alive in it,
// which is exactly the number the owner wanted at a glance.
//
// SO THE PERIOD IS NOT A PREFERENCE, IT IS THE CLIENT'S CADENCE (JOS-269). When the heartbeat went
// 5 min → 10 min, a 300-second bucket stopped meaning "sessions alive" and started meaning "the
// half of them whose pulse happened to land in this window" — the readout would have halved
// overnight with nothing wrong. `BUCKET_MS` therefore tracks `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` by
// definition, and the only honest way to change one is to change the other.
//
// THE CROSSOVER IS THE ONE PERIOD THIS CANNOT BE EXACT OVER, and it is worth naming because the
// fleet auto-updates over days: while some installs still run the 5-minute build, each of those
// contributes TWO heartbeats to a 10-minute bucket and is counted twice. It reads high, it decays
// as the fleet updates, and it is bounded by the share of the fleet on the old build. The
// alternative — keeping the 5-minute bucket — under-counts the NEW build by half and gets WORSE
// as the rollout proceeds, which is the wrong direction for a number to drift.
//
// IT SITS BESIDE `buildAnalytics`, NEVER INSIDE IT (the `ghDownloads.ts` precedent, same
// reasoning): that function is pure over three arrays of counter rows and stays testable without
// a socket. This module is called in parallel with the database read and merged at the
// presentation edges — `ipc.ts` for the tab, `triageAnalytics.mts` for the digest.
//
// FAILURE IS SOFT, ALWAYS. No credentials, no stack cache, a throttled API, a region that does
// not answer: every one of them is `available:false` with a reason the caller prints in place of
// the number. A dark CloudWatch may not take down a readout that is otherwise about a database.
//
// THE DERIVATION IS SEPARATE AND PURE (`deriveLiveSessions`), so `tests/liveSessions.test.mts`
// drives every shape of fleet — nobody, a steady fleet, a fleet that just arrived, one that has
// been up longer than the window — against authored buckets and no AWS at all.

 *
 * THE AGE IS AN ESTIMATE, and here is the whole of it. Nothing knows when an individual session
 * started; what the buckets say is how many sessions were alive in each. A session is continuous,
 * so one that is alive now and was alive j buckets ago was alive in every bucket between — which
 * makes the count of now-sessions at least j buckets old at most the SMALLEST bucket in that span,
 * and exactly that if no session ends and is replaced inside one bucket. Summing that bound over j
 * is the mean age in buckets (the survival-function identity: E[age] = Σ P(age ≥ j)).
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT HONEST RATHER THAN A GUESS is what it does at the edges:
 *   * it is a FLOOR, never an over-claim — `min` cannot count a session that is not there, and a
 *     fleet that churns within a bucket reads as YOUNGER than it is, not older;
 *   * a window that is fully occupied back to its oldest bucket sets `ageIsFloor`, because the
 *     sessions may be older than anything this read can see;
 *   * with nobody alive the age is NULL, not zero: an empty fleet has no age, and a 0 there would
 *     read as "everyone just arrived".
 * The label carries one word — `est.` — and the caveat diet is why it carries no more than that.
