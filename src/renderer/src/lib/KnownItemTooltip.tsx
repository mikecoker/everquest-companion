// KnownItemTooltip — the hover layer for an item NAME anywhere in the main window.
//
// It answers the two questions a name alone can't: "what IS this" (the EQ-style item window)
// and "what is it FOR" (the quests that use it / the recipes that consume it) — plus, one hop
// deep, "and what do I get out of that" (the quest's reward items, the recipe's result), each
// of which is itself hoverable.
//
// RELATIONSHIP TO THE OTHER TWO SURFACES:
//   ItemTooltip (features/posky) — the posky-specific hover: it already HAS its stat blob and
//     shows drop/island knowledge. Unchanged; this one is the generic, knowledge-fetching kin.
//   ItemDetailDialog (features/loot) — the CLICK layer, the deep dive (drop rates, timeline).
//     Unchanged. Hover explains, click investigates.
//
// FETCH-ON-OPEN, NEVER PER ROW: the lookup lives inside the tooltip BODY, and MUI mounts a
// Tooltip's `title` node only while the tooltip is open. So a 5,000-row loot table costs zero
// lookups and zero module subscriptions until a name is actually hovered (the same precedent
// ObservedItemWindow's header states). A caller that already holds the record (the loot view's
// knowledgeByKey map) passes it in and no fetch happens at all.
//
// NESTING: nested MUI Tooltips, capped at ONE level. The outer card is interactive (the mouse
// may enter it — that's how you reach an outcome name); the nested card is NOT interactive and
// opens to the SIDE, so you read it without ever needing to move onto it, and the outer never
// has to close to let you. A depth-1 card renders its own outcomes as plain text, so there is
// no third popper and no infinite chain. A click-to-pin Popover was the alternative; hover won
// because every other item surface in the app is hover-first and a pin would need a dismiss
// affordance on a surface that has none.
//
// CLICK-THROUGH MODE (`clickThrough`, JOS-181) — how this card is allowed BACK onto a surface
// that has a dropdown toolbar over it. Twice now (JOS-127 on the Loot ledger, JOS-143 on the Sky
// tab) the owner has been unable to work a `Select` because a card belonging to a row UNDER the
// toolbar opened upward across it and held the pointer; both times the answer was to delete the
// card, and on the Sky tab the owner has now ruled the trade the other way — the card comes back,
// the defect does not. So the mode fixes the three things that made the card a click-eater, and
// each of them is stated here rather than inherited:
//   1. it opens DOWNWARD (`bottom-start`) and CANNOT go up — `flip` is disabled, and so is
//      `preventOverflow`'s main axis, which is the other modifier that can slide a card back
//      across the row it belongs to. A card whose top edge is always below its anchor's top edge
//      can never be on a toolbar its anchor is below. (The price is honest: a card anchored on
//      the very last visible row is clipped by the window bottom rather than flipping above it.)
//   2. it holds NO pointer events. `disableInteractive` already gets MUI's popper there, but the
//      guarantee is written out as `pointerEvents: 'none'` as well — a default is someone else's
//      decision, and this one is the whole defect.
//   3. it CLOSES ON POINTERDOWN, anywhere, in the capture phase — so the card is gone before the
//      control the user just aimed at opens its own list, rather than floating over the options.
// The mode is opt-in per call site because the interactive outer card is a real feature elsewhere
// (it is how you hover a quest REWARD name inside the card); what makes it structural is that a
// surface under a toolbar mounts the card through one wrapper that always passes it, and
// tests/tooltipCursor.test.mts derives that from the tree.
//
// MAIN WINDOW ONLY: it draws ObservedItemWindow, which subscribes to the itemTiers module over
// `window.eq`. The overlay bundle has no such bridge (and stays MUI-free) — the overlay gets
// the tradeskill FILTER, not this card.
