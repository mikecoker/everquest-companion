// useWindowedRows — a dependency-free fixed-row-height windowing hook.
//
// The app's dense lists (loot rows, spell rows, pack rows) are fixed-height dense
// rows — the ideal case for simple windowing: we only render the slice of rows that
// intersects the scroll viewport, plus a small overscan, and reserve the total
// height with two spacer elements (top + bottom). This keeps the rendered DOM node
// count bounded (≈ viewport / rowHeight) no matter how long the list is, so a filter
// keystroke never has to mount hundreds of MUI rows synchronously.
//
// Why hand-rolled (not react-window): the lists are uniform-height and this is ~1
// screen of code with zero deps — see AGENTS.md "search pattern" note. For
// variable-height surfaces (Accordions) we cap+paginate instead of windowing.
//
// Usage:
//   const scrollRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
//   const win = useWindowedRows({ count: rows.length, rowHeight: 33, scrollRef })
//   return (
//     <div ref={scrollRef} style={{ overflow: 'auto', height: '100%' }}>
//       <div style={{ height: win.topPad }} />
//       {rows.slice(win.start, win.end).map(...)}
//       <div style={{ height: win.bottomPad }} />
//     </div>
//   )
// For a <table>, render the spacers as rows with a single full-colspan <td> whose
// height is set (see LootView) so the browser's table layout keeps the geometry.
//
// THE LISTENERS BIND TO THE ELEMENT, NEVER TO THE REF (JOS-260). A ref object is stable for the
// life of the component, so an effect keyed on it runs ONCE — and a caller whose container node
// is replaced (unmounted and remounted under the same ref, as the Loot ledger's detail takeover
// does) stranded the scroll listener and the ResizeObserver on the DETACHED node. The window then
// froze at whatever slice it held: about thirty rows, the rest of the ledger blank on scroll —
// the 0.23.0 report this hook was root-caused from. The container is therefore held in STATE, and
// a layout effect with no dependency array re-reads the ref after every commit and adopts the
// node when its identity changes (the `setEl` bails on `Object.is`, so a steady container costs
// one ref read per commit and no render). Every consumer whose container mounts and unmounts with
// the hook was already immune; this makes the whole class impossible rather than conventional.
