// GearAreaTabs — the header that turns four views into one place (JOS-324).
//
// WHAT IT IS. The gear area is four views (appViews.ts `GEAR_AREA_VIEWS`) behind ONE nav row, and
// this bar is how you move between them. It is drawn above the mounted view — outside the content
// area's scroll box, so it stays put while a long table scrolls under it — and only while the
// current view is one of the four.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT A ROUTER. Every tab click calls the app's own `selectView`, the same function the
// nav drawer's rows call. That is deliberate and it is the whole reason this collapse cost no
// semantics: the Back stack treats a tab click as MANUAL navigation and drops the parked trail
// (navOrigin.ts), the outgoing view unmounts on its `viewKey` exactly as it always did, and a deep
// link into any of the four still lands with the bar already reading the right tab. A bespoke
// in-area router would have had to re-earn all three.
//
// CHARACTER SITS IN THE RUN, LEFT OF WISH LIST (owner ruling 2026-08-13). The first cut pushed it
// to the right-hand edge to say "answer, not question" with a gap — and the gap said it so well
// the owner reported the tab missing within the hour. A tab nobody can find states nothing; four
// tabs in one run is the honest shape, and the order (appViews.ts `GEAR_AREA_VIEWS`) keeps truth
// beside the search tabs it grounds, with intent last.
//
// The bar renders even on a machine with no character logs, where the content underneath is the
// fresh-machine empty state. That matches the nav drawer, which likewise draws every row on such a
// machine: navigation chrome that vanishes with the data would strand a reader on whichever
// surface they happened to open.
