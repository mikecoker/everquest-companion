// cursorRing.ts — the entire renderer half of the cursor ring.
//
// It lives in `src/renderer/src/overlay/` beside the meters but shares NOTHING with them: no
// React, no MUI, no theme, no shared component. The meters are a UI; this is one <div> that
// moves. Pulling in a framework to move a div would add a reconciler to the hottest path in the
// app for no expressible benefit — so this file is plain DOM, and it is the whole module.
//
// ============================ THE PERFORMANCE CONTRACT ============================
// The owner's requirement was "it can't feel like it's lagging". Three rules make that true,
// and every one of them is visible in the ~15 lines of real code below:
//
//   1. THE REAL CURSOR IS NEVER TOUCHED. Windows draws the system pointer; this window is
//      click-through and `cursor: none`. Only the halo follows, so even if a frame is dropped
//      the pointer the user is aiming with is exactly where it always was. There is no path by
//      which this feature can make the mouse itself feel heavy.
//   2. NEWEST POINT WINS; STALE POINTS ARE DROPPED, NEVER QUEUED. Main streams samples at
//      ~8 ms — faster than any display refreshes. We keep ONE variable and paint it on the next
//      animation frame. A backlog is therefore impossible by construction: if ten samples land
//      between two frames, nine are overwritten and cost a single assignment each. Queueing
//      them would be exactly the "feels laggy" failure — a ring replaying where the mouse USED
//      to be.
//   3. COMPOSITOR-ONLY PAINTING. The ring element is created once, sized once (and again only
//      when the user changes the setting), and thereafter only its `transform` changes. That is
//      a GPU layer translation: no canvas, no repaint, no layout, no style recalc that touches
//      anything else. There is no timer in this file at all — no rAF is scheduled while the
//      mouse is still, because main sends nothing while the point is unchanged.
