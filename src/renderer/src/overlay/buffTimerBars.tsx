// buffTimerBars — the BAR BODY of the 'buffs' overlay (JOS-89). BuffsOverlay.tsx is the window
// chrome; this file is the rows. Design record: docs/plans/buff-timer-overlay.md.
//
// THE BAR IS THE CLAIM. A row draws a receding bar if and only if `spells.json` STATES a
// duration for what it is showing — because a bar is a promise about when something ends, and
// this surface does not make one it cannot keep. An unknown-duration row therefore has NO BAR AT
// ALL and prints elapsed time counting up beside a `+`. That absence is the honest signal, and it
// is the whole visual difference between "18s left" and "you have had this for 18s".
//
// MUI-FREE ON PURPOSE, like every file in this bundle: the overlay is its own renderer entry with
// no theme and no component library. `fmtDuration` is imported rather than re-spelled — the app
// gets ONE duration formatter (AGENTS.md UI conventions), and features/buffs/format.ts is a pure
// module that pulls no MUI in behind it.

 * because the surface it sits on floats over a game the player is busy in:
 *
 *   1. IT DOES NOT EXIST WHILE THE WINDOW IS LOCKED. A locked overlay is click-through by law
 *      (`setIgnoreMouse`), so a control on it would be a lie; BuffsOverlay passes no `onDismiss`
 *      until the window is unlocked, and then the button is not rendered at all.
 *   2. IT IS INVISIBLE AND UNCLICKABLE UNTIL THE ROW IS HOVERED (`pointerEvents: 'none'`), so
 *      there is nothing under the cursor to catch a stray click aimed at the game behind it.
 *   3. IT TAKES TWO PRESSES. The first ARMS it — the glyph becomes the word `clear?` — and the
 *      second, within {@link DISMISS_ARM_MS}, is the one that clears. Anything slower disarms.
 *
 * The label says what it does and what it does not: it clears the BAR, and unlearns nothing.
