// overlayScale — WHERE THE TEXT SIZE IS APPLIED, and the only place it is.
//
// An overlay window is two layers with different jobs, and the scale belongs to exactly one:
//
//   CONTROL CHROME (header + selector, footer, the toast's drag frame) lays out at scale 1
//   against the REAL window width. It is what you reach for when a window is wrong — the lock,
//   the alpha slider, A− / A+ itself — so it can never be the thing that grows out of the
//   window. Scaling it is what the first cut of this feature did (a CSS zoom on #overlay-root),
//   and at 2.0 on a narrow overlay the footer walked off the right edge with A− on it.
//
//   CONTENT (the bars, the feed rows, the toast cards) is the reading matter the scale is FOR,
//   and it is the only thing zoomed.
//
// CSS `zoom`, not `transform: scale()`: zoom participates in layout, so an auto-width child
// resolves its width against the pane divided by the zoom and fills it at every scale — the rows
// REFLOW instead of a magnified bitmap hanging off the pane's edge. Height it cannot fix, which
// is what the scroll pane below is for: at 2.0 you get fewer rows on screen, not fewer rows.
//
// MUI-FREE like the rest of this bundle.

 * sized to be crossed rather than aimed at: the pointer arriving from the left, above or below
 * generates a move inside the strip before it reaches the bar, and that move is what arms the
 * grip. Coming at the bar from OUTSIDE the window's right border can miss the strip entirely —

 * THE FOOTER ROW'S SHARED SKELETON — and the one rule in it that is not cosmetic (JOS-278).
 *

 * to spell this box out itself. They are collected here for a single reason: `flexWrap`, which is
 * how a footer DEGRADES on a narrow window.
 *
 * Its items do not shrink, by an older and still-correct law (TextScaleStepper: "a button clipped
 * mid-glyph is the control you needed and could not press"). On a one-line row that law had a hole
 * in it — items that will not shrink and cannot wrap simply RUN PAST the window's right edge, and
 * the page clips them (`overflow: hidden` in overlay.html). MEASURED at the old 200px floor: the
 * buffs window's A− and A+ sat at x=211 and x=237, the debuffs window's at 207/233, the XP
 * window's stepper at 216. Three kinds shipped with their text-size control off the screen at the
 * smallest size the app itself allowed.
 *
 * Wrapping spends HEIGHT to buy that back — the row becomes two lines, the content pane above it
 * gives up the difference (it is the flex child with `minHeight: 0`) and every control stays
 * reachable. Nothing changes at ordinary sizes: a footer whose items fit on one line never wraps.
 * The height a wrapped footer costs is what sets the window's minimum HEIGHT (overlayLayout.ts
 * `OVERLAY_MIN_SIZE`), so the two numbers move together.
 *
 * `gap`, `fontSize` and `color` stay with each kind — they genuinely differ (6 vs 8, and the
 * respawn footer inherits its type) and none of them is load-bearing here.

 *
 * `overflowX: hidden` because the rows ellipsize rather than run wide, and a horizontal bar here
 * would eat a row's worth of height to say nothing.
 *
 * A PINNED OVERLAY SCROLLS NOW, AND ONLY AT ITS RIGHT EDGE (JOS-138; owner disposition
 * 2026-08-09, on a 0.14.0 report that pinning killed the scrollbar). It used to be true by
 * construction that it could not: pinned means `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true, {forward:true})`, and
 * `forward` forwards mouse MOVES and nothing else — a wheel notch is delivered to whatever is
 * under the cursor after the OS hit test, which for a click-through window is the game. So the
 * wheel cannot arrive unless the window stops ignoring the mouse for as long as it takes, which
 * means SCROLLING AND CLICK-THROUGH CANNOT BOTH BE TRUE OF THE SAME PIXEL. That is a real trade,
 * not a bug to engineer around, so it is made where it costs least:
 *
 *   - the pane watches the forwarded moves it already receives and, while the window is LOCKED
 *     and the rows genuinely overflow, takes the mouse (`capture('scroll', …)`) for exactly the
 *     time the pointer spends within SCROLL_GRIP_W of the right edge — the strip the scrollbar
 *     is drawn in, so the affordance is the bar the user is already reaching for;
 *   - everything else in the body is untouched and stays genuinely click-through, which is the
 *     point of pinning and what the e2e asserts alongside the scroll;
 *   - and both halves of the interaction come with it: the WHEEL, and DRAGGING THE BAR, because
 *     the grip hands the real scrollbar real mouse events rather than re-implementing scrolling.
 *
 * No new IPC and no new mouse hook: this is the P3 named-reason sensor with a fourth reason, over
 * the forwarding the meters already pay for (see useOverlayChrome's CaptureReason).
 *
 * A caller that passes no `capture` gets the old pane exactly — the event log and the buffs
 * overlay hold capture over their WHOLE window while hovered, which already carries the wheel and
 * is the same trade taken at the other extreme.
