// THE METER'S CRUMB ROW — the one line above an overlay meter's bars, on every meter kind.
//
// It carries TWO things, and it is the only place either of them lives (owner ruling, 2026-08-05
// — JOS-35):
//
//   THE WAY OUT. A back chevron whenever there is a level to go back TO — damage-fight,
//   damage-overall, heal-fight and heal-overall alike. It used to be four hand-rolled crumbs with
//   four different opinions: healBars offered Back unconditionally at level 2, while meterBars
//   withheld it whenever the drilled subject happened to be the level the meter had opened on
//   (`canLeave`, added in 9d5df44) — which, with the pet preference on, was ALWAYS. Two of the
//   four kinds could not be zoomed out at all. One component, one rule, no per-kind opinions.
//
//   THE FIGHT TIMER. It moved DOWN here out of the header, which now states the subject and the
//   rate and nothing else — a 380px-wide header holding a live dot, a kind tag, a scope chip, a
//   name, a chevron, a clock, a rate and two icon buttons had no room left for the one thing it
//   is for (the fight's NAME). The clock is the same `SegmentView.durationSec` it always was,
//   printed by the same `fmtDur`; it just sits on a line with room for it.
//
//   THE AGGREGATE (JOS-158, owner direction 2026-08-09 with a screenshot). The rate followed the
//   clock down out of the title bar, for the same reason and one more. The reason: a title bar
//   whose one job is a mob name was still handing ~55px of itself to a number. The one more: up
//   there the number was UNLABELLED, sitting a few pixels from a fight name and a few rows above
//   a bar reading `5.2k dps` that means something else entirely. Here it can say what it is.
//
//   SO IT IS LABELLED, AND THE LABEL IS THE HONEST ONE. `all` — every source the engine attributed
//   outgoing damage (or healing) to in this segment: you, your pets, your group, whoever swung.
//   It is the SAME `SegmentView.outDps` / `HealingView.hps` the header printed, moved and not
//   recomputed, which means it is deliberately NOT re-scoped by the meter's Whose-damage
//   preference the way the bars below it are. That gap is exactly what the word is for: a
//   You-scoped meter showing one bar and an `all` figure larger than it is telling the truth, and
//   the panel floor is already saying which scope the bars are under (overlay/scopeFloor.tsx).
//
//   AND IT IS VISUALLY DISTINCT FROM THE PERSONAL FIGURE, which is the other half of the ruling:
//   it wears the meter's ACCENT at full weight on the chrome row, while every bar's own number is
//   plain white inside a bar. Colour, weight, position and a word — four differences, so `all
//   21.7k dps` on the crumb and `5.2k dps · 300k` on your bar can never be read as the same claim.
//
// LOCKED MODE passes `onBack: null` — the same row renders, with no chevron, no pointer and no
// hit target, because a click-through window may not offer an affordance it cannot deliver. The
// aggregate is NOT chrome and does not vanish with the lock (the scopeFloor.tsx rule): a pinned
// meter is precisely the one with no header tail, no selector and no tooltip left to state it.
//
// ONE COMPONENT, FOUR KINDS (the JOS-119 no-fork rule). damage-fight, damage-overall, heal-fight
// and heal-overall all render this row, so the label, the layout and the treatment are one
// decision. What each meter supplies is only its own already-formatted number and accent — dps
// and hps are different units and `lib/formatRate` is the one place either is spelled.
//
// MUI-FREE ON PURPOSE: the overlay is its own renderer entry (overlay.html) with no theme and no
// component library. Plain React + inline styles, like every file in this bundle.
