// THE PET NUDGE, AS THE PLAYER SEES IT (JOS-258).
//
// One sentence, laid over the meter's own content background, for a little while after a pet
// summon that nothing has bound. It is the owner's ruling rendered literally:
//
//   NOT OVERLY WORDY        one line of copy and no second sentence. There is no tooltip, no
//                           "why am I seeing this", no link to preferences. The UI convention this
//                           repo already runs on (the tooltip and caveat diet) says the label earns
//                           its keep or it goes, and this label's whole job is to name the two
//                           keystrokes that fix the thing.
//   IN OVERLAY, ON THE
//   CONTENT BACKGROUND      absolutely positioned inside the bars pane rather than stacked above
//                           it, so it never reflows a row, never resizes the window, and cannot
//                           become a banner the meter is permanently shorter for. It sits over the
//                           top of the pane because that is where a freshly-summoned pet's row is
//                           NOT (an unbound pet has no row at all - that is the whole defect).
//   TIMES OUT               there is no dismiss button and no local state. The engine's snapshot
//                           carries the nudge or it does not; this renders exactly that, poll by
//                           poll (useOverlayCombat re-asks every second). A component that
//                           remembered anything could disagree with the engine about whether the
//                           window is still open, and that disagreement is what "staleness" means.
//
// CLICK-THROUGH LIKE THE REST OF THE PANE (`pointerEvents: 'none'`, the ScopeFloor rule): a pinned
// meter offers no hit target below its header, and a coaching hint is precisely the thing that must
// not become the exception - it would eat a click aimed at the game underneath it.
//
// MUI-FREE, like every file in this bundle.
