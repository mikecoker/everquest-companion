/**
 * The floating HEALING overlay (Task #59) — the 'heal-fight' / 'heal-overall' twin of the DPS
 * OverlayMeter. Same window machinery (kind from `?kind=`, per-kind persisted config, locked
 * click-through vs interactive, persisted drill), same selection semantics ('heal-fight' picks a
 * FIGHT, 'heal-overall' picks a ZONE SESSION), and the same bar treatment: labeled stats embedded
 * after the name, `{min} - {max}` ranges, the TOTAL alone at the right end.
 *
 * Its own file on purpose: the damage meter's flattening, category colors and stat run are about
 * damage taxonomy, and healing has none of that. The small amount of shared bar styling is
 * duplicated below rather than extracted, so this component can evolve without touching the DPS
 * overlay.
 *
 * WHAT THE LOG SUPPORTS (and what it does NOT) — the honesty contract this UI keeps:
 *   - EFFECTIVE healing is what a heal line reports; OVERHEAL is real and derived, not invented:
 *     EQ writes `for N (M) hit points` exactly when M > N and omits the parens otherwise.
 *   - HoT ticks are INDISTINGUISHABLE from direct heals (no `healed over time` / `regeneration`
 *     line family exists), so there is no HoT/direct split anywhere in this UI.
 *   - ABSORPTION RANKS AS HEALING, LABELED. Rune grants are a lane in the SAME flat drill list as
 *     the heal spells and count toward the total, because a shield is sustain. It is told apart
 *     by its own cool COLOR and by WORDING — "Rune", "granted", "absorbed" in the stat run —
 *     never by a chip: a badge overflowed the bar at overlay width, and the color plus the words
 *     already say it. The honesty note (absorption GRANTED, not consumed) lives in the hover
 *     title, not in inline chrome. Absorption is never called restored hit points and never
 *     shows an overheal (a rune has none, and one is not invented for it).
 *   - The other two absorption families (absorbed swings, absorbed damage-shield ticks) carry NO
 *     amount at all, so they are COUNTS in the footer — never a bar, never in a total.
 *
 * DRILL SHAPE: healer → ONE flat ranked list of lanes (`Lay on Hands VI · Healing · Rune`). No
 * grouping level, deliberately: removing the category level is what made the damage drill-down
 * legible, and a separate "absorption" section here would repeat that mistake.
