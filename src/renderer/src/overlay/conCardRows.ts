// conCardRows — WHAT THE CON CARD ACTUALLY PUTS ON SCREEN: which resist chips survive (JOS-383,
// narrowed by JOS-386, narrowed again by JOS-390).
//
// PURE, and imported by relative path in the tests, because this repo has no jsdom: the rules are
// unit-tested here (`tests/conCard.test.mts`) and the JSX is asserted by the e2e against the real
// app. Same split as `features/resists/resistRow.ts` and `features/mobs/dropEra.ts`.
//
// IT USED TO RANK THE DROPS TOO, and that half is GONE rather than moved (JOS-390, owner ruling
// 2026-08-16): the card is the mob's header, its resist chips, and the click that opens the mob
// page — where the drop table, the fold over `+N` variants and the perceived rate already live and
// always did (`features/mobs/MobDropsSection.tsx` over `seenVariants.ts`). Deleting the card's copy
// is the point: two rankings of one drop table is exactly the drift this file's old header warned
// about, and the surviving one is the surface with room to explain itself.

/**
 * THE CARD SAYS WHAT THE THING RESISTS, AND NOTHING ELSE (owner ruling, 2026-08-16).
 *
 * JOS-383 shipped five chips, always, in one fixed order, and the argument for that was a good one:
 * an axis that is simply MISSING says neither "we have not seen fire cast on this" nor "fire is
 * fine", and a reader cannot tell which. That argument still stands where it was made — THE MOB
 * PAGE STILL SHOWS ALL FIVE ROWS, every time, and it is one click away.
 *
 * What it does not survive is this surface. This is a card you read in the two seconds before you
 * pull, over the game, and four of its five chips routinely say "this is ordinary" — which is the
 * answer you would have assumed without reading anything. Every one of them costs a line of window
 * that has to be composited over a running game, and (the reason this ticket exists at all) height
 * that the window now literally wears. So the card keeps the axes where the answer would CHANGE
 * WHAT YOU CAST, and the card's own empty state carries the rest of the meaning.
 *
 * THE CUT IS THE BENCHMARK'S OWN BOUNDARY (JOS-387, which re-derived the same four words from a
 * viewer-relative benchmark instead of from a band of R). The two words that change what you cast
 * stay; `weak` and `normal` — the band whose guidance sentence is `should land` — leave. Reusing
 * the tag is what keeps the card and the page from disagreeing about what `resistant` means, the
 * same reason the chip's colour and word are imported rather than spelled twice.

/**
 * A chip that survived the cut, and WHY it survived.
 *
 *   `benchmark`   the model answered and its band is one of the two above.
 *   `resistRate`  the fit did not fit (`pinned`) and the raw observations carried the chip instead:
 *                 at least half of the informative casts were resisted. A creature that resists
 *                 half of everything must not vanish from the card because the estimator could not
 *                 name a number for it — that is the Eye of Veeshan defect, and it is exactly the
 *                 case where a player most wants the warning.
 *
 * THERE IS NO THIRD ROUTE (JOS-400). JOS-397 added one — a run of three recent resists could earn a
 * chip its place and print `lately resistant` on it — and the owner removed it the same day: a
 * second verdict beside the formula is not the formula, and the recency the ruling kept is the decay
 * INSIDE the estimate (`shared/resistDecay.ts`), which reaches this card through `tag` like
 * everything else.

 * chip that says "no data", and a card that answers a question you asked about a mob with five
 * shrugs is the emptiest version of the thing this cut is about. The page still says it.
 *
 * A LOW-SAMPLE RESISTANT AXIS SURVIVES, with its existing caveat. The ruling is about axes that do
 * not matter, never about withholding an answer that does — that is JOS-382's law and it is not
 * touched here: a resistant cell standing on three observations is exactly the case where the wide
 * interval and the `low samples` note are the honest display.

/**
 * WHAT THE CARD IS, said once, for the reader who cannot see the underline.
 *
 * IT IS AN `aria-label`, AND IT MUST NEVER BECOME A `title` (JOS-358, owner ruling of 2026-08-16 —
 * *let's drop tooltips in the overlays, even in the title bar*). JOS-390's brief asked for a native
 * `title` on the card body on the grounds that this bundle is popper-free, which it is; what that
 * reasoning misses is that a popper-free bundle is exactly where the ruling came FROM. An overlay is
 * always-on-top over a running game and a native tooltip is drawn by the widget rather than by the
 * page, so the pointer can walk off and strand it over EverQuest — the release-blocking report
 * behind JOS-358, and `tests/overlayTooltipPolicy.test.mts` is a DERIVED sweep of this whole
 * directory that fails the moment any file here hands the DOM a tooltip attribute. (It reads the
 * SOURCE, comments included, which is why this paragraph does not spell the attribute out.) So the
 * card takes the title bar's own remedy: its controls are NAMED, never hovered.
 *
 * The words are a DESTINATION rather than an instruction ("Open in the app", never "click to
 * open"): the repo's UI law is state, never process. The SEEING reader's hint is the name wearing a
 * link's underline, which draws no popup and cannot be stranded.
