// ============================================================================
// What's new — the browsable release history, and the app's own home for it (JOS-73).
// ============================================================================
//
// WHERE IT LIVES, AND WHY. Preferences → What's new, its own row in the section rail, directly
// under Updates. Three candidates were on the table and this one wins on both counts that
// matter:
//
//   * DISCOVERABILITY. The teaser strip is a one-launch affordance that a user can dismiss
//     forever in half a second, so it cannot be the only door. A named row in a rail somebody
//     already scans is a door you can find on purpose, months later, without remembering that a
//     strip once existed. Version already lives one row up in Updates, so this is where a person
//     looking for "what version am I on, and what changed" is already standing.
//   * IT IS A READING SURFACE WITH NO CONTROLS. That is exactly the argument this repo already
//     made twice — Performance and Usage analytics are SECTIONS rather than lines under
//     something else because a diagnostic/readable surface does not belong tucked inside a card
//     about switches (PreferencesView.tsx). Release history is the same shape, only more so.
//
// …and the Version row up in Updates carries a "What's new" link straight to it, so the version
// number itself is clickable in the way the ticket asked for, without a second copy of the panel.
//
// A GROWING LIST IN A SCROLL BOX THAT FILLS THE PANE (AGENTS.md UI conventions; JOS-76). Fifteen
// releases today and one more every time we ship; letting it size to its content would push the
// rest of the Preferences column off the screen the way the combat log once did. It shipped first
// at a fixed 420px, which was the other failure — a short window of history floating in a tall
// empty pane. The box now CLAIMS the pane's remaining height (`flexGrow:1` + `minHeight:0`
// through the chain PreferencesView opts this one section into), so a tall window shows more
// releases and a short one still scrolls inside the box rather than moving the section chrome.
//
// STATE, NEVER PROCESS: the panel says what changed. It does not explain where notes come from,
// how "new" is computed, or that anything is stored — the two chips are the whole disclosure.

 * The full release history on GitHub — the one link out of this panel (JOS-254).

 * WHY A PANEL THAT IS ALREADY THE ANSWER CARRIES A DOOR OUT OF ITSELF. What ships in a build is
 * every release UP TO that build (the notes are committed source — shared/releaseNotes.ts), so
 * the one question this panel structurally cannot answer is "what came after the version I am
 * running". The releases page answers it, and it is where the downloads and the tags live for
 * anybody who wants them. It opens in the SYSTEM BROWSER: `target="_blank"` is turned into
 * `shell.openExternal` by main's `setWindowOpenHandler`, which passes only an allowlisted https
 * URL — and the `github.com` entry on `EXTERNAL_LINK_ALLOWLIST` (src/main/security.ts) is scoped
 * to THIS repo's subtree (JOS-263), so it opens this link and nothing else on the host. Keep this
 * constant pointing inside `github.com/jmoyers/everquest-companion/`; anywhere else silently
 * fails to open.
 *
 * It sits BELOW the scroll box rather than inside it: leaving the app is the last thing on offer
 * here, never the first, and a link that scrolled away with the history would be a door that
 * moves.
