// Renderer-local COMBAT view preferences — the same idiom as `eq.combat.scope` in useCombat.ts
// (localStorage, renderer-side, no store/IPC round trip), with one addition it needs and that
// one didn't: these prefs are read by surfaces that never share a mount.
//
// The Preferences tab writes them; the Combat tab, the Overview card AND the floating overlay
// meters read them. App.tsx's `ViewContent` mounts exactly ONE feature view at a time, so a plain
// `useState` initialised from localStorage would already be correct on the next mount — but a
// same-document `localStorage.setItem` fires no 'storage' event, so anything that IS mounted
// alongside the writer (a preference and its own live example, today or tomorrow) would go
// stale. The tiny subscription below closes that: one write notifies every reader in this
// window, so "changing it applies live" is structural instead of incidental.
//
// AND ACROSS WINDOWS, WHICH IS WHY THE OVERLAY MAY READ IT (measured, 2026-08-04). The overlay is
// a second renderer entry in a second BrowserWindow, so the in-window `listeners` set below can
// never reach it. It doesn't have to: every window of this app is ONE ORIGIN, so localStorage is
// literally the same store and the cross-document 'storage' event does the notifying. Verified in
// this Electron rather than assumed, on the case that could plausibly have differed — two
// `file://` documents (the packaged app's `index.html` and `overlay.html`, loaded by path, no
// dev server): both report `location.origin === 'file://'`, a write in one is readable in the
// other, and the other receives a `storage` event carrying the new value. So the overlay reads
// the SAME key by the SAME hook, and no copy of this preference is ever routed over IPC.

// it can be node-tested (combatPrefs.ts says why). This file is the storage half and nothing else.

 * kind — on the theory that a docked meter and a pinned two-inch overlay get asked different
 * questions. In practice that was three controls to find and three answers to keep straight for one

 * only Preferences > Combat writes it.

 * version: an inferred roster can be incomplete as easily as empty, and a meter missing a real
 * group-mate's bars reads as a broken meter. Only the ABSENT key moves — a stored 'group' is an
 * answer the user gave and is handed straight back.
 *
 * A value that is not one of the three — a hand-edited localStorage, a key written by a future
 * build — degrades to the default rather than rendering an empty meter (combatPrefs.readMeterScope).
