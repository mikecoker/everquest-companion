/**
 * Dashboard: FOUR EQUAL panels in a 2x2 grid — source meter, DPS over time, PROCS, damage by mob.

 * THE ARRANGEMENT (JOS-37, owner ask). Cell 3 used to be the dedicated "You" breakdown preview:
 * a category bar plus your top skills, which is exactly what drilling your own row shows. It
 * retired. The cell went to PROCS — previously hidden behind a tab pair inside that very card,
 * where the owner could not find it, and the one dashboard subject that belongs to the SELECTION
 * rather than to a source. Multi-attack (the old Rounds block) deliberately did NOT take a cell:
 * it is a statement about one SOURCE's swings, so it stays in the drill beside that source's
 * skill list — a top-level "your multi-attack" panel would have re-created the You panel this
 * ticket just deleted. Four cells, four subjects: WHO, WHEN, WHAT FIRED, WHOM.
 *
 * `minmax(0, 1fr)` on both axes is the load-bearing bit: it lets every track
 * shrink below its content, so no panel can dictate the grid's size (the old flex rail gave the
 * meter a 1.5x column and squeezed the other three into a strip, and an intrinsic-size track is
 * exactly how a growing panel used to push the page taller). Each cell is a `fill` panel: 100%
 * of the cell, its own internal `overflow: auto`. At md the region is `overflow: hidden` and
 * sized by flexGrow between the header and the fixed-height combat log — so the view still has
 * NO page-level scroll (Task #56). Below md it collapses to ONE column of comfortably-tall
 * panels and the region scrolls.

 * breakdown whenever the pet preference was on (`petRows.defaultDrill`, deleted) — a shortcut from
 * when this app assumed solo play, and one that hid every group-mate's row behind a chevron the
 * moment the meters learned about groups.
 *
 * …AND WHERE YOU LEFT IT IS WHERE YOU COME BACK TO (JOS-116). Those are not in tension: the
 * opening level is still level 1 and nothing auto-drills, but a drill you performed is no longer
 * thrown away by the tab switch that unmounts this view. It lives in `useDrillMemory`, beside the
 * abilities you had expanded inside it, and it survives a restart the way the overlay's has all
 * along.
 *
 * …AND IT IS NO LONGER PER-FIGHT (JOS-240, owner): drill your own row on one pull, flip to the
 * next pull, and you are still reading your own row. A drill is a QUESTION, and the fight picker
 * above it exists so the same question can be asked of another fight. It is still PER-DIRECTION —
 * enforced on the mode handler, `undrilling` below — and a fight that has no such subject shows
 * the clean source list while the memory waits for one that does.
 *
 * That rule lives on the CHANGE HANDLER and never in an effect keyed on `selection`/`mode`. An
 * effect fires on MOUNT, which is precisely the moment this view has just hydrated a stored drill;
 * and `selection` arrives asynchronously from main (useGlobalFight), so it would fire a second
 * time a frame later. Either firing wipes the value the ticket exists to keep. The overlay learned
 * this first and says so in OverlayMeter.tsx.

/**
 * THE ONE NAVIGATION THAT MAKES A DRILL STOP MEANING ANYTHING — and it is no longer the fight.
 *
 * IT USED TO BE FOUR (JOS-116): pick another fight, flip Fight↔Overall, switch
 * Outgoing↔Incoming↔Healing, or follow a deep link here from another tab, and the meter went back
 * to level 1. The premise was that "the subject you were reading is not on screen any more" — true
 * of the DIRECTION, and false of the other three, which change WHICH SEGMENT the same question is
 * asked of. Comparing your own breakdown across two pulls is the whole reason a fight picker sits
 * above a drillable meter, and it meant re-clicking into the same row every single time (JOS-240,
 * owner).
 *
 * SO ONLY `setMode` UNDRILLS NOW, because the three directions are three different lists of
 * subjects: Outgoing ranks you and your allies, Incoming ranks the mobs hitting you (and offers no
 * drill at all), Healing ranks healers. Carrying a token sideways between them is not "the same
 * row in another fight", it is a token that means nothing where it lands.
 *
 * WHAT REPLACES THE OTHER THREE IS RESOLUTION, NOT MEMORY-CLEARING. The drill is a token, and
 * `petRows.meterPanel` has always resolved it against whatever segment is on screen and degraded
 * to level 1 when it resolves to nothing (the JOS-105 rule) — so a fight lacking that subject
 * already renders the clean source list, without anybody wiping the stored value. JOS-240 only had
 * to stop the wiping and make the token's identity survive the trip: it now carries the row's NAME
 * beside its id, because half these ids are per-spawn world instances (`petRows.resolveSubject`).
 *
 * The FIGHT SELECTION IS GLOBAL (useCombat/useGlobalFight: it lives in main and the overlays share
 * it), so the clear was never even reliable — a fight picked in an overlay moved this view's
 * selection and this handler never ran. One behavior in both directions is the fix, not a second
 * clear somewhere else.
 *
 * WHERE THIS LIVES IS STILL JOS-116'S ANSWER: on the HANDLER, never in an effect keyed on `mode`.
 * An effect cannot tell a user's click from a mount, and this view mounts holding a stored drill —
 * so the effect that used to enforce this rule cleared the value the ticket existed to keep, twice
 * (once on mount, once when the global fight id arrived from main a frame later). The overlay
 * reached the same conclusion first and OverlayMeter.tsx states it at length.
