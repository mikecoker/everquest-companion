// The DPS-curve GEOMETRY: turning a DpsSeries into the polyline/polygon point strings the
// chart draws, plus the mappings a hover layer needs to read the drawing backwards. Split out of
// CombatDashboard.tsx as pure, MUI-free arithmetic — the panel that renders it is then just the
// SVG, and the sizing constants live with the maths that uses them.
//
// The `@shared/*` imports here are TYPE-ONLY and erase, so tests/dpsChartHover.test.mts can load
// this under tsx with no renderer alias (see timelineHitTest.ts's header).
//
// COORDINATES, because this is the trap on this chart: the SVG is a fixed 720-unit viewBox drawn
// at `width="100%"` with `preserveAspectRatio="none"`, so X is STRETCHED to the card's width and
// Y is 1:1. A raw `clientX - rect.left` is therefore not an X on this chart — every px↔user
// conversion goes through `pxToUser`/`userToPx`, and every user↔time conversion through
// `xAtT`/`tAtUserX`, which are exact inverses of each other.
//
// ONE TIME BASE (the marker-jitter fix). `{t0, t1}` is the single time span this chart maps across
// its inner width, and EVERYTHING reads it: the polyline vertices, the marker ticks, the elapsed
// axis, the hover's X→time inverse and its grab radius. Both ends are exact multiples of
// `series.bucketMs` — t0 = the first drawn bucket's start, t1 = the last drawn bucket's END — so a
// live window advances by exactly one bucket per bucket and never by a wall-clock fraction.
//
// That last part is the whole bug this shape exists to kill. The curve is drawn from BUCKETED
// samples, but markers carry exact instants; when the two were mapped through different spans
// (vertices spread evenly over `count-1` intervals, markers scaled against a right edge that was
// the live `durationMs` — i.e. `now`) the marker mapping was both permanently stretched by
// count/(count-1) AND re-scaled on every snapshot as the partial last bucket filled. Markers
// therefore crept against a curve that only moved in whole-bucket steps: the observed swim. A
// canvas would have repainted exactly that mismatch, faster.
//
// The sample for bucket `i` is anchored at the bucket's CENTRE (`bucketCenterMs`), which is the
// instant a `dpsAt` lookup at that x resolves back to — so a marker that landed mid-bucket sits on
// the same x the curve's own sample does, and the hover dot, the tooltip's rate and the tick all
// name the same bucket. The cost is a half-bucket inset at each end of the drawn line (0.4% of the
// width on a scrolling 2:00 window); the gain is that no vertex claims a time it does not stand for.
