// HOW THE FLAT LEVEL-2 LIST COLLAPSES NEAR-DUPLICATE ROWS INTO ONE.
//
// The meter's ability list is "one bar per engine skill" (JOS-113) with exactly two documented
// departures, and both live here so they share one merge, one ranking and one pair of labels:
//   - the Slay Undead aggregate (`groupSlay`, still in dashboardData beside the flatten it
//     belongs to) — one proc seen through four weapons;
//   - the spell-component merge (`groupSpellComponents`, JOS-244) — one spell seen through two
//     of the log's message shapes.
// Neither touches the engine. A group is a PRESENTATION of rows the engine already computed, so
// every total, category rollup and timeline lane is byte-identical either way (law 8); the merged
// rows survive as `children` inside the group's own expansion, one click down and no new nav
// level.
//
// Pure, JSX-free and node-tested. `SkillRow`/`FlatSkill` come back from dashboardData as TYPES
// only, so the import that closes the loop is erased at build time and there is no runtime cycle.

/**
 * ONE SPELL IS ONE ROW, however many message shapes it printed (JOS-244, user report
 * 01KZSRAYCHF4ZX1PEP4RSPPM07 — "combat parsing is tracking the damage component of dot
 * separately").
 *
 * A DoT that also lands an initial direct hit prints its two halves in two different sentences,
 * and the game spells the SPELL DIFFERENTLY in each. Measured on the reporter's own slice, one
 * cast of one spell:
 *   `You hit <mob> for 55 points of poison damage by Envenomed Bolt.`   → skill "Envenomed Bolt"
 *   `<mob> has taken 419 damage from your Envenomed Bolt VI.`           → skill "Envenomed Bolt VI"
 * The landing sentence DROPS the rank numeral the tick sentence keeps — the same divergence
 * `spellCanonKey` was written for, since a fade/fizzle line drops the rank too — and the taxonomy
 * files the two under different categories, `spell` for the direct hit and `dot` for the ticks.
 * So the flat list grew TWO bars for one button press: "Envenomed Bolt VI" 14,131 and "Envenomed
 * Bolt" 189 in the reporter's biggest fight, with Plague VI 3,925 / Plague 181 beside them. It IS
 * one spell: every `You begin casting Envenomed Bolt VI.` in that slice is followed within two
 * seconds by exactly one landing line, 1:1 across four casts, and then by the tick train.
 *
 * The answer is the `groupSlay` answer one category over — the user reads them as one ability, so
 * the list shows ONE row and the split is one click down.
 *
 * THE KEY IS `spellLineKey` AND NOTHING ELSE — the shared mirror of the parser's own
 * `spellCanonKey` — so "the same spell" means here exactly what it means everywhere else in the
 * repo. Two consequences fall out of that, and they are why no marker handling is needed:
 *   - JOS-167's cast/proc split SURVIVES. A cast-less lane's name ends in the ` · proc` marker,
 *     which is a suffix no rank tail can sit behind, so "Envenomed Bolt · proc" keys apart from
 *     "Envenomed Bolt" and the two lanes the owner asked for stay two lanes.
 *   - Only `spell` and `dot` rows are eligible. A weapon lane is named after a VERB rather than a
 *     spell, and folding one into a spell that happens to share its name would be a lie about a
 *     lane rather than a merge of two descriptions of one cast. `melee`/`slay`/`ds` never enter.
 *
 * The group's NAME prefers a rank-bearing spelling ("Envenomed Bolt VI" over "Envenomed Bolt"):
 * the rank is real information the user pressed a button for, and only one of the two shapes ever
 * carries it. Its CATEGORY — the row's color — is the largest child's, so a DoT with a small
 * direct component reads as a DoT; both halves are stated in the expansion, so the color
 * summarizes rather than claims.
