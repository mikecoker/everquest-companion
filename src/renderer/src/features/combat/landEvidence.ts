// LANDED vs RESISTED, on a lane that may print no damage at all (owner report, 2026-08-04).
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO END. A rogue effect proc lands by printing a per-spell EMOTE
// (`<mob>'s limbs move slower!`) and never a damage line, while its resists print the spell name
// like every other spell (`A wanderer resisted your Weakening Strike!`). So the combat drill
// built the lane entirely out of resists and rendered `0 landed · 34 resisted` — a 100% resist
// rate for a proc that landed 562 times in the same log, three inches from a Procs panel counting
// every one of those emotes.
//
// `SkillView.lands` now carries those landings (joined in at view-build from the proc ledger's
// own strike map — see `procViews.effectLandings`). Two shapes follow from it, and the SECOND is
// the one that keeps this honest:
//   - landing evidence EXISTS (damage hits, emote landings, or both) ⇒ a resist rate is a real
//     division and gets stated.
//   - NO landing evidence exists at all ⇒ there is no denominator. A hand-cast Divine Stun deals
//     no damage AND prints nothing when it lands, so `8 resisted` is everything the log will
//     ever say about it, and inventing `100% resist` out of the resists alone is the exact lie
//     being removed. The count is exact; only the division is withheld — law 5, the same rule
//     the proc rates already follow.
//
// ITS OWN MODULE rather than a corner of dashboardData.ts: three surfaces read it (the bar's
// inline run, the expanded readout's Resists figure, and the hover that explains an absence),
// and the wording is the whole point, so it earns a file where the reasoning sits beside it.
// MUI-free and JSX-free, like its neighbours, so the node tests can assert the strings directly.
