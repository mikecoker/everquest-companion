// PET NESTING — a PRESENTATION regrouping of the snapshot's existing source rows. No JSX, no
// MUI, no engine involvement: the engine hands us YOU and each PET as separate, authoritative
// `SourceView`s and this module only decides how they are LAID OUT.
//
// IT IS *THE* METER, NOT ONE METER'S HELPER (owner ruling, 2026-08-04): "the overlay is using a
// different source of data — combat has a breakdown with pet appropriately merged and overlay
// does not — this should not be possible, they should be using the same underlying api and
// abstraction — if not, collapse." They were two folds giving two answers: the Combat tab built
// its rows here, while the floating overlay asked the ENGINE for a `combinePets` fold (a
// synthetic "You +pets" source with namespaced skill lanes and no pet line at all). That engine
// fold is now DELETED — not deprecated, deleted, along with its parameter — and `meterPanel`
// below is the single row builder every damage-meter surface calls: the Combat tab's panel, the
// floating overlay, the Overview card. A second builder has nowhere left to live.
//
// MUI-FREE AND JSX-FREE ON PURPOSE. The overlay is its own renderer entry (overlay.html) with no
// theme and no component library, so the shared abstraction has to be plain TS to be importable
// from both bundles. Keep it that way: colors, bar chrome and crumbs stay in each surface.
//
// WHY (owner direction, 2026-08-03): the game is mostly played solo, so "your damage" and "the
// pet's damage" are two rows of a two-row meter and the interesting list is one level down. The
// default view is therefore YOUR breakdown with the pet as ONE line item inside it, drillable to
// the pet's own skills. A preference ('Show your pet inside your damage') turns the nesting off
// and restores the separate sources.
//
// LEVEL 1 IS THE DEFAULT, EVERYWHERE (owner ruling, 2026-08-05 — JOS-35). Every damage meter and
// the Combat tab OPEN on the ranked source list: one bar per combatant. Auto-drilling was the
// solo-play shortcut of 2026-08-03/04 (`defaultDrill`, now deleted), and it stopped being right
// the moment the meters grew group members — a meter that opens inside YOUR breakdown hides the
// four other people in the fight behind a chevron nobody knew to press. A drill the user makes is
// still remembered per surface; the out-of-box level is 1.
//
// THE PREFERENCE IS THE PET'S LAYOUT, AND ONLY THAT. `combine` no longer decides a level; it
// decides where the pet's damage LIVES, at every level:
//   ON  ⇒ the pet is NOT a source row of its own. Its damage rides inside YOUR level-1 bar
//         (`meterSources` below folds it in), and it appears exactly once more: as one named,
//         drillable line item inside your breakdown. Nowhere else — a pet listed both as its own
//         bar and inside your row was the double-count the owner saw (JOS-35).
//   OFF  ⇒ the pet is its own level-1 bar and nothing is nested; your breakdown is yours alone.
//
// HONESTY (world-model law 4 — "pet" is presentation, never a data-model class; law 5 —
// aggregates lie, derive from identities):
//   - The pet row is labelled with the pet's REAL display name off its own source row. It is
//     never a coined label ("Pet"), and it is never folded into one of YOUR skill lanes: your
//     per-skill numbers stay exactly the engine's, and the pet's total sits BESIDE them as its
//     own row. Nothing here adds a point of pet damage to a row of yours.
//   - One line item that DRILLS is what the owner asked for, not a merged lane list. The engine's
//     retired `combinePets` fold did the latter, which is why it is gone rather than reused.
//   - `total` here is self + nested pets, which is exactly `SegmentView.outTotal` whenever the
//     only outgoing sources are you and your pets (they are, by construction — the aggregate
//     keys outgoing damage as 'you' or 'pet:<id>'). Every surface that shows a combined headline
//     reads `outTotal`, so the two can't drift.

 * WHAT THE HEADLINE OVER *THIS* PANEL COVERS — the one derivation every UNLABELLED damage

 *
 * THE DEFECT IT FIXES, in the owner's words: "with a fight drilled into the You row, changing the
 * pet preference does not recalculate the You line - the pet was moved out, and the title line for
 * the You drill kept the old combined total (321 in the observed case)."
 *
 * Nothing was memoized wrong and nothing was snapshotted at drill time. The headline was simply
 * the SEGMENT's aggregate at every level — you + your pets + whoever else swung — and while the
 * pet was folded INTO your row that aggregate happened to be exactly what the You drill was
 * showing (`total` there is self + nested pets, which IS `outTotal` for a solo fight; see the
 * header of this file). Turn the preference off and the pet's damage leaves the drill while the
 * headline stays where it was: a number no visible row accounts for, which is the "aggregates
 * lie" failure (world-model law 5) and the exact reason `meterScope.scopeTotals` exists one axis
 * over. The preference did not fail to apply — the rows moved and the headline was never asked to.
 *
 * SO IT IS DERIVED FROM WHAT THE PANEL IS SHOWING, at whichever level it resolved:
 *   level 1 ⇒ the caller's already-scoped pair, unchanged (the ranked list IS the segment, minus
 *             whatever the meter scope filtered — which `scopeTotals` has already accounted for).
 *   level 2 ⇒ the drilled subject plus the pets nested INTO it, which is exactly what
 *             `MeterPanel.rows` sums to. Flip the preference and `pets` empties, so the number
 *             follows in the same render — in both directions and without re-selecting anything.
 *
 * `dps` is SCALED rather than re-derived, for `scopeTotals`' reason: every source's rate divides
 * by the same segment elapsed time (`main/combat/sourceViews.ts` — `s.total / durationSec`), so
 * the ratio is exact arithmetic rather than a second opinion. That also makes it the right call
 * for the ACTIVE-time rate, which no source carries at all: one function, either rate.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TOUCH: the overlay meters' crumb figure, which is LABELLED `all`
 * and states the whole segment on purpose (JOS-158, owner direction with a screenshot —
 * overlay/meterCrumb.tsx says so at length). That is the rule this ticket makes explicit: a
 * headline that SAYS what it covers may cover the segment; an unlabelled one sitting above the
