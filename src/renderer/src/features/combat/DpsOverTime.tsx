// The DPS-over-time CARD, whole: header stats, the three curves, the marker ticks, the elapsed
// axis, the legend, and the hover layer that reads the drawing backwards.
//
// It lives in its own file because TWO surfaces render it now — the Combat dashboard's 2x2 grid
// and the Overview tab's glance row. The ONE-source rule (AGENTS.md) applies to the whole chart,
// not just its colors: a second copy would drift in exactly the places that matter least visibly
// (which marker kinds get a legend entry, whether the peak is `~`-prefixed, where the hover dot
// sits) and most honestly. So the card is extracted, not forked, and `DpsChartCard`
// (CombatDashboard.tsx) is now a thin wrapper over it with the same testid and the same layout.
//
// COMPACT is the only thing the two callers differ on — see the prop's comment for exactly what
// it drops. It never changes the CURVE: same geometry, same markers, same hover, same numbers.
//
// Everything here is cheap inline SVG (no chart libs) and every derivation is a single pass in
// `dashboardData.ts`/`dpsChart.ts`; the memos are keyed on the timeline's IDENTITY, which the
// Combat tab stabilises so a frozen finalized fight doesn't re-derive on every 1s snapshot tick.
