// PER-ABILITY STATS, INLINE (JOS-113) — one bar per ability, and clicking a stat-bearing one
// opens ITS OWN crit / double / triple / miss beneath it.
//
// WHY THIS REPLACES A LEVEL (owner, JOS-113, correcting JOS-105): JOS-105 grouped the drill under
// a CATEGORY level — a "Melee" chip above the ability bars, and a third drill level per damage
// type carrying the multi-attack readout. The owner rejected that: "one bar per ability, flat, as
// before — Dragon Punch, Melee, Kick, each its own bar. NO category grouping layer, NO category
// strip. Click an ability that has stats and the ability's own stats appear inline beneath its
// bar." So the double/triple that used to live one level down now attaches to the ABILITY it
// belongs to, and the per-ability crit/miss the flat row already expanded (combatShared.SkillBar)
// gains it. There is no "which category does this round belong to" judgement any more — a round
// lane's counters are that lane's ability's, and a lane names exactly one ability (below).
//
// ENGINE UNTOUCHED, LAW 8 HOLDS. Every number here is read off the engine's existing rollup — the
// SkillView's own crits/resists/misses, and the round lanes' own swing-count buckets. Nothing
// derives a damage amount, so no total moves (the same tripwire multiAttackRows.ts lives under).
//
// PURE TS, RELATIVE/ TYPE-ONLY IMPORTS. Like multiAttackRows/categoryDrill before it, this module
// is exercised by node tests that run without the renderer's `@shared` value alias and is imported
// by the MUI-free overlay bundle. No JSX, no MUI, and only a TYPE borrow of `@shared/combat`.

 *   - a direct spell that CRIT → crit rate is worth stating.
 *   - a GROUP row → its children ARE the thing to expand (JOS-244). Without this a merged spell
 *     row could hide its own components: a DoT whose ticks never crit passes none of the tests
 *     above, and collapsing two bars into one that will not open would take information away
 *     rather than tidy it. The slay group has always passed on its category; this is the same
 *     rule said generally, so no group is ever a dead end.
 * A DoT tick has none of these — no swings to miss, no rounds, and DoT ticks do not crit in this
 * engine — so it does not expand; its resist rate, if any, already rides the bar face (SkillBar).
