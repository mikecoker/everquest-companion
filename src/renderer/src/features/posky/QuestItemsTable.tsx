// posky/QuestItemsTable.tsx — the expanded quest panel's item listing, and the item-name LINK
// both halves of the accordion draw.
//
// Split out of `QuestAccordion.tsx` when the item deep link pushed that file past the measured
// 400-code-line ceiling (2026-08-04). The seam is real rather than arbitrary: everything here is
// the "what do I still need, who drops it, where" table, while what stays behind is the collapsed
// summary row and the accordion chrome around it. No behaviour changed in the move.
//
// THE ITEM NAME IS A LINK (owner, 2026-08-04): "clicking on a sky item while you are hovering
// should take you to the item drill-down page." The click is the app's standing link idiom
// (`openLoot`, appRouting.ts), the same one the Planner's donor names use. `ItemNameLink` is
// exported because the summary row's REWARD caption is the accordion's other clickless item name
// and gets the same affordance; the required-item chips beside it do NOT, because their click
// already toggles the favorite star and swapping that would trade a feature for a link.
//
// AND THE HOVER CARD IS BACK (JOS-181), after JOS-143 removed it. The name used to anchor
// `ItemTooltip`, a `placement="top"`, INTERACTIVE card that opened UPWARD — out of this table,
// through the accordion summary, and onto the tab's dropdown toolbar, where it ate the clicks aimed
// at them (the owner's report; JOS-127 is the same defect on the Loot ledger). Removal was the
// answer then; the owner's v0.18.0 ruling is that the card is worth more than the removal, and the
// defect is now fixed IN THE POPPER instead: every card on this tab goes through `SkyItemCard`,
// which opens downward, cannot flip up onto the toolbar, holds no pointer events, and closes the
// moment a pointer goes down. HOVER EXPLAINS, CLICK INVESTIGATES — the click still opens the Loot
// drill-down, which is the deep dive the card is a preview of.

/**
 * An item NAME that opens that item's Loot drill-down, and hovers into the item card. The cursor
 * follows the CLICK handler exactly — a hand only where a click actually goes somewhere — so a tree
 * rendered without the router keeps the plain hover surface it has always had.
 *
 * It sets no colour: the table cell already tints a completed item green and the reward caption is
 * already primary, so borrowing the item-window green here would erase the state those colours
 * carry. The dotted underline is the whole affordance.
 *
 * The card is mounted HERE rather than around this component at the two call sites, because a MUI
 * Tooltip hands its anchor a ref and a plain function component cannot hold one — the anchor has to
 * be the Box itself. Both call sites get the card for free, which is also what makes the reward
 * caption in the summary row hoverable without a second wrapper.
