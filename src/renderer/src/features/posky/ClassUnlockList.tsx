// from, so nothing here can quietly present a wiki claim as an observation.

 * hover — the house rule about controls, honoured by not adding a popper rather than by tuning one.
 *

 * also opened the Quests tab would make pinning a class impossible without leaving the tab you
 * pinned it on — the star's whole job is to change THIS list's order, which you have to stay here
