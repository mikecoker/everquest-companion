// Same discipline as `dashboardData.ts` and `rows.ts`: anything that DECIDES something —
// what a tile says, how wide a bar is, whether a cell is a number or a dash — is a pure
// function here, so `tests/usageAnalytics.test.mts` can assert it without React, without a
// DOM and without a cluster. The .tsx beside it is then only layout.
//
// THE HONESTY RULES LIVE HERE, because they are formatting decisions:
//   * A null RATE renders as `—`, never as `0%`. "No update has ever been reported" and
//     "every update failed" are opposite facts and must not share a glyph.
//   * A cohort younger than the horizon renders as `—`, not `0`: nobody can have survived to
//     a day that has not happened yet.
//   * Percentages are of a stated base, and the label says which base.
