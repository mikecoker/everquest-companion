// AnalyticsBits — the Analytics tab's shared primitives and its three leaf sections.
// ============================================================================
//
// Split out of `AnalyticsPanel.tsx` when the user/owner cohort split pushed that file past the
// repo's 400-code-line ceiling. The same call `usageStore.ts`, `usageRows.ts` and
// `triageAnalytics.mts` all made: a split, not a widened threshold.
//
// WHAT LIVES HERE AND WHY IT IS THIS CUT. Everything below is a pure function of the data it is
// handed — no state, no IPC, no window choice, no cohort logic. `AnalyticsPanel` keeps exactly
// the parts that make DECISIONS (which window, which cohorts, which of the three states to
// render); this file keeps the parts that only draw. The three sections here are the ones with
// no cross-section dependencies at all: Health, Versions and Retention each read one slice of
// `TriageAnalyticsData` and render it.
//
// Both files render both cohorts — there is deliberately nothing cohort-aware in here, because a
// cohort's readout is just a `TriageAnalyticsData` and the whole point of the split is that the
// owner's numbers go through the identical renderer rather than a second, drifting one.
