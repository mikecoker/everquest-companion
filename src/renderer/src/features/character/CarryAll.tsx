// character/CarryAll — EVERYTHING YOU CARRY (JOS-327): the whole dump, searchable.
// ============================================================================
//
// The grid above this table draws twenty-four cells. The file it draws them from lists a hundred
// and twenty-three things on the owner's own character — bags, bank, the tradeskill depot, thirty
// seven key-ring rows — and every one of them was parsed, counted into `heldCounts` and then never
// shown to the person who typed `/outputfile inventory`. This is that list, and nothing else.
//
// READ-ONLY, DELIBERATELY. No stars, no "add to plan", no upgrade simulation, no row click. Those
// all exist one tab to the left, on surfaces whose whole job is deciding what you SHOULD have; this
// one answers "what do I have and where did I put it", and a surface that answers one question
// completely is worth more than a surface that half-answers two. A row is text.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// TWO CONTROLS, ONE AXIS EACH
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The box asks WHAT (a substring of the item's name) and the chips ask WHERE (which lane of
// `shared/carryAll.ts` the row is in). The split is why the search key is the name alone — folding
// the location in was measured and made `ring` match all thirty-seven `KeyRing` rows, which is not
// what anybody typing `ring` wants. See the carryAll header for the lanes themselves, including
// why there is no chip named after the Dragon's Hoard.
//
// THE CHIP CHOICE IS PERSISTED AND THE QUERY IS NOT, and that is the standing law rather than a
// coin toss: a view unmounts on every tab switch, so anything the user set ON PURPOSE lives in a
// renderer pref (JOS-90/97/116). A lane is a choice you make and keep; a half-typed search is not,
// and a box that greeted you with last week's query would be a worse surface, not a better one. The
// stored lane DEGRADES rather than errors (JOS-105): a value naming a lane this dump has no rows
// for simply reads as "All".
//
// …AND JOS-329 FOUND THE HOLE IN THAT SENTENCE, WITHOUT CHANGING WHAT IT ARGUES. "Persisted" and
// "not persisted" were being treated as the only two options, so the query was thrown away by every
// TAB SWITCH as well as by every launch — and the first of those was never the intent. The argument
// above is about what a NEW SESSION should open on, and it survives intact; what it needed was a
// second tier to be true in. The query is on the SESSION tier now (`gear/areaMemory.ts`, whose rule
// this paragraph is the original statement of): it comes back when you step to another module and
// return, and it is gone when you next launch the app, which is exactly what the sentence above
// asks for. The lane is unchanged, on the restart tier, under its own key.
//
// THE LIST IS WINDOWED AND THE BOX IS BOUNDED — `useWindowedRows` over a `tableLayout: fixed`
// table whose every row is exactly `ROW_HEIGHT` tall (the fixed-height contract, lootRows.tsx),
// inside its own `overflow: auto` scroller that takes the height the sheet above it leaves. A
// hundred and twenty-three rows would not need windowing; a bank-clearing session's dump might,
// and the pattern costs nothing.
