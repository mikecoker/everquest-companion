// crossZone.ts — "where is that, then?" answered across the WHOLE world, not just the map you
// happen to be looking at (JOS-135).
//
// THE REPORT THIS EXISTS FOR: standing in High Pass, searching `Tarn Visilin` and being told
// nothing. He is a High Keep NPC, and before this the Maps tab could not say so — the pane's mob
// section is the catalog joined to the zone ON SCREEN, and its cross-zone section searched the map
// files' own LABEL text, which no Brewall pack spells that name in. Two corpora, both scoped in a
// way that put the answer in the gap between them.
//
// SO THE CROSS-ZONE LIST NOW HAS TWO SOURCES, AND EVERY ROW SAYS WHICH ZONE IT IS TALKING ABOUT:
//
//   1. THE MAP CORPUS — `maps:search` with no `zone`, which main has always been able to do
//      (packs.ts `corpusRows`). Label text in every installed pack.
//   2. THE WIKI'S BESTIARY — the committed 7,872-row mob catalog, matched on the mob's NAME.
//
// NAME-ONLY HAYSTACK, and that is a deliberate difference from the Mobs tab (mobSearch.ts tokenizes
// name + zones). Here the ZONE IS THE ANSWER, printed on every row, so admitting zone tokens to the
// query side would make `high keep` return that zone's entire 93-row bestiary and bury the name
// matches this section exists to find. The toolbar's zone selector is how you ask for a zone.
//
// ONE RANKED LIST OVER BOTH, because ranking is only meaningful within one order: `shared/fuzzy`
// scores both halves (exact 1 > prefix .85 > substring .7 > typo ≤ .6), so an exact mob name
// outranks a substring label hit rather than losing to it for being in the second list. The zone
// ON SCREEN never appears here at all — those rows are the pane's own two sections, and listing
// them twice under two headings would make the headings meaningless.
//
// PERFORMANCE: A FLAT SCAN, MEASURED, NOT AN INDEX. Over the real 7,872-row catalog with
// name-only haystacks (throwaway probe, 2026-08-09): `tarn visilin` 5.4 ms cold / `ambassador`
// 1.2 ms / `a bandit` 6.0 ms / `x` (384 hits) 0.7 ms — inside a keystroke budget the pane defers
// anyway. Tokens are built ONCE, LAZILY, keyed on the catalog array itself (the mobSearch.ts
// posture; a WeakMap so a test's synthetic catalog does not leak).
//
// WHAT IT REFUSES TO INVENT. A row is only PLACED when the page names exactly one zone — the same
// rule `mobRows` applies on the map you are standing on, for the same reason: `|location` is one
// field and `|zone` may name several, so nothing on the page says which zone the numbers describe.
// An unplaceable row is still listed (the mob does live there, and that is the fact being asked
// for); it opens the zone and claims nothing more. A zone spelling the hand-authored table refuses
// (`Freeport`, `Various`, and the wiki cells whose links ran together — see zones.ts) resolves to
// NO map, and the row says so under the wiki's own spelling rather than guessing a stem.
//
// RELATIVE value imports, the repo-wide rule for node-tested pure modules (mobPins.ts:38).
