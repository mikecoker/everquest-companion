// RecentlyConsidered (Task #63; moved here from BossView in Task #64) — "what have I been
// sizing up".
//
// It shipped on the Raid Targets tab because that tab already answered the OTHER mob question
// ("which named things have I killed") and a con strip needed a home. It now has a real one:
// considering is the everyday form of looking a creature up, so it belongs on the tab whose
// whole job is creature knowledge, beside the search box that answers the same question
// deliberately. Raid Targets goes back to being about raid progression only.
//
// SIZE IS A CONTRACT: a FIXED-height scroll box (AGENTS.md — "a growing list lives in a
// fixed-height scroll box"), so a long session can never push the rest of the tab below the
// fold. It also renders NOTHING at all until something has been conned, so a player who never
// uses /con pays no vertical space for it.
//
// WHAT A CON IS FOR, HERE (owner decision, 2026-08-03). The con's DIFFICULTY verdict — "suicide",
// "might win", "safe" — is ephemeral: it is a statement about the gap between your level and the
// mob's ON THE DAY YOU CONNED IT, and it is wrong the moment you ding. The DURABLE facts the con
// line carried are the mob's NAME and its LEVEL; the difficulty clause is just the conduit that
// delivered them. So the row shows name + level + when you conned it, and the classification is
// no longer rendered at all (the module still captures it — this is a display decision, not a
// data-model one). The app's faction palette went with it: coloring a name by faction made the
// strip read as a threat meter, which is exactly the ephemeral claim we stopped making.
//
// TYPOGRAPHY: these rows sit directly under the zone roster, so they use the SAME hierarchy as
// MobResultRow — semibold body2 name, caption metadata, theme text colors only.
