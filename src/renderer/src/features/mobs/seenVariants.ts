// seenVariants.ts (JOS-196) — the ONE fold that turns your own loot history for a mob into
// DROP LINES, plus the perceived rate those lines carry.
//
// THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES. `MobLootIndex` (src/main/mobLookupParse.ts) files your loot under the
// RAW item name, exactly as the log spelled it — which is correct, because that index is a
// record of what happened and `Sphinx Claw +1` is what the line said. But EQ Legends drops
// upgraded `+N` variants of nearly everything, so one item's history off one mob arrives as
// three rows saying `1×`, `1×`, `1×` where the honest reading is `3×`. Every count on the page
// was quietly divided by however many upgrade tiers the mob had rolled for you, and a drop rate
// derived from any one of those rows understates the item by the same factor.
//
// ONE DERIVATION, NO SECOND PARSER (repo law 2, and JOS-66's `itemCountKey` is that derivation).
// This module folds on `itemCountKey` — the same key the quest/held/reconcile counting boundaries
// use — and `itemVariantLevel`, which is spelled in terms of `normalizeItemName` rather than a
// second ` +N` regex. There is exactly one statement in the tree about what a `+N` suffix is.
//
// FOLDING IS A DISPLAY DECISION, AND THE VARIANTS ARE NEVER THROWN AWAY. The group keeps every
// row it folded, in upgrade order, so the page can collapse by default and still hand over the
// individual `+1` / `+2` the moment the reader asks (law 2: canonicalize at boundaries, display
// raw — the raw names are one click away, never deleted).

// The TYPE may keep the alias (it is erased); the counting keys are VALUE imports and are
// spelled relatively, so the node test suite can import this module directly — mobSearch.ts's
// precedent, now repo law.

 * display states the denominator so the reader can judge it.
