// MobsView (Task #64) — the MODULE HOME for creature knowledge.
//
// WHY A TAB OF ITS OWN. Three surfaces already knew things about mobs and none of them was a
// place you could go: the events overlay's con rows (a glance, over the game), the Raid Targets
// tab's "recently considered" strip (lodging with raid progression because it needed a roof),
// and a modal that opened over whichever list you happened to be in. "What is this thing and
// what does it drop" is a question you ask deliberately, about any of 7,866 mobs — most of
// which you have never conned and none of which are raid targets. That is a tab.
//
// THE HIERARCHY, as shipped:
//   Mobs (this view)                    the creature knowledge home
//     ├── search                        the whole committed catalog, fuzzy, offline
//     ├── In <zone>                     what lives WHERE YOU ARE  ← the default surface
//     ├── Recently considered           what you've been sizing up  ← moved off Raid Targets
//     └── MobPage                       THE detail surface, app-wide
//   Raid Targets                        raid progression only — a roster + your kills; its
//                                       cards now route HERE instead of opening their own modal.
//
// THE BROWSE SURFACE IS AN OVERVIEW OF WHERE YOU ARE. It used to open on "Recently considered"
// + "Most considered" — two views of the same con ring, one of which ("what you keep coming back
// to") answered a question nobody was asking while a "Most considered" chip cloud pushed
// everything else down the page. What you actually want when you open this tab mid-session is
// the bestiary of the room you are standing in, and then what you were just sizing up. So the
// zone roster leads, in a fixed-height scroll box (AGENTS.md — a growing list never grows the
// page), the con strip sits below it with its own bounded height, and "Most considered" is gone.
//
// TWO STATES, one view: the BROWSE surface (search box + zone roster + con strip) and the DRILL
// page, with a breadcrumb back — the same shape the combat tab uses for a fight drill-down,
// rather than a second modal.
//
// SEARCH is client-side and instant (AGENTS.md "Search"): the input echoes immediately, the
// filter runs on a deferred value, and the catalog is an ES-imported JSON already bundled for
// main's mob lookup. No IPC, no network, works offline.
