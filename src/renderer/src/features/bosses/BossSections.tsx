// BossSections — the roster's CARDS and the two ways of sectioning them. Split out of BossView
// so that view is the toolbar + the filtering it owns, and so a second grouping could be added
// without the file growing past the factoring ceiling.
//
// TWO GROUPINGS, ONE GRID. `CategorySection` is EQ raid progression order (Open World → Fear →
// Hate → Sky) and stays the default: it is what the roster is FOR. `LoadoutSections` answers the
// other question this app can now ask — "which classes was I running when I killed these?" — by
// TIME-JOINING each kill run against the class-combo intervals (loadoutGroups.ts, which owns
// the pure half of that join, over shared/comboIndex).
//
// THE JOIN IS A DISPLAY GROUPING AND NOTHING ELSE. bossStatus.ts stays combo-unaware, no kill
// record is stamped with an interval id (ids are recompute-unstable by design — see
// shared/comboIndex.ts), and no signal changes: the same kills, the same confetti, the same
// bossDefeat sound. Only the headers above them are new.
//
// ONE ROW PER TIER-RUN, not per target (2026-08-04). The rule used to be "a target killed
// repeatedly lands under the loadout of its MOST RECENT kill" — the only rule the old
// five-scalar kill record could state, since it carried a `bestTier` and a `lastTs` that could
// come from different kills. It filed Lord of Ire's d4 badge (Aug 01, PAL/MNK/ENC) under the
// ROG/PAL/BER interval covering its Aug 03 d0 kill. The record is now per instance tier
// (shared/kills.ts), so a multi-tier target splits into one card per tier: each joins the
// combo interval at ITS OWN most recent kill and wears ITS OWN tier badge, and the header's
// claim is true of every card under it. Single-tier targets — nearly all of them — project to
// exactly the card they rendered before.
//
// ONE SECTION PER LOADOUT (JOS-236, 2026-08-12). A section is a claim about CLASSES, not about a
// span of the timeline, so every interval stating the same trio draws ONE header here — the
// owner's board was showing PAL / MNK / ENC twice because he had swapped away and back. The rule
// and everything it decides (which member's chips, whose provenance, how the union span is
// worded, what the badge means) lives in loadoutGroups.ts's header; this file only draws it:
// `spansText` over the section's members instead of `spanText` over one, and a tooltip that
// spells the stretches out when there is more than one.
//
// AND A HEADER MAY DECLINE TO NAME A LOADOUT (JOS-239, 2026-08-12). The owner's roster showed Lord
// Nagafen defeated at D4 under `ENC / WIZ / MNK`; the wizard was level 25 and had never entered the
// zone. `loadoutGroups` now routes intervals that fail the confidence gate into ONE unresolved
// section, and this file draws it as `Mixed loadouts` + the spans — deliberately the same shape as
// the `Loadout not known` header, because it is the same kind of sentence (a fact about our
// knowledge, not about the classes) and the surface should not grow a third dialect for it.
