// The PURE half of the roster's "by class loadout" sectioning: which cards go under which
// combo interval. Split out of BossSections.tsx so the join is unit-testable without a DOM —
// it is the layer the Lord of Ire misattribution actually lived in.
//
// THE RULE, stated once. A card is a TIER RUN, not a target: one target's kills at one
// instance tier, which carry their own first/last timestamps (shared/kills.ts). Each run joins
// the combo intervals at ITS OWN most recent kill and is badged with ITS OWN tier, so a
// section header ("you were running these classes") is true of every card beneath it. The old
// rule joined at the target's overall `lastTs` while painting its overall `bestTier`, so a mob
// killed at d4 in one loadout and d0 in a later one showed a d4 badge under the later loadout.
//
// Two runs of the same target that land in the SAME section merge back into one card: the
// header's claim holds for both, and one target must not appear twice under one header.
// A single-tier target therefore produces exactly the card it produced before this change.
//
// The interval layer itself is untouched and stays revisable — nothing here stamps an interval
// id onto a kill (world-model law 10); the join happens at read, every time.
//
// ONE SECTION PER LOADOUT, NOT PER INTERVAL (JOS-236, owner-reported while release-testing: the
// board drew PAL / MNK / ENC as two separate groups). An INTERVAL is a contiguous span of one
// BELIEVED loadout, so leaving a trio and coming back to it — or a `/who` restating it, or any
// boundary a detector cuts inside it — produces TWO intervals carrying the SAME classes. The
// interval layer is RIGHT about that and is untouched here: "which loadout killed that" is a time
// join and needs every boundary it has (shared/comboIndex.ts). But a section header states "you
// were running these classes", and two of them said the identical sentence twice.
//
// THE MERGE RULE. Sectioning groups intervals whose LOADOUT is identical, order-insensitively:
// each slot's candidate set sorted, then the slots sorted — deliberately the same identity
// `mergeable` uses in src/main/modules/comboIntervals.ts, so the two layers can never disagree
// about what "the same loadout" means. What differs is what the rule is allowed to do, and that
// difference is the ticket: `collapse` there rewrites the MODEL, so it merges only ADJACENT
// intervals across a SOFT boundary (a `/who`, a level drop or a user range is a real event and
// deleting it would delete evidence). Here nothing is rewritten — every member survives verbatim
// in `LoadoutGrouping.intervals` — so a section merges non-adjacent members and merges across a
// hard boundary, a user-locked span and an overruled one alike: those flags qualify how we KNOW
// the loadout, never which loadout it was.
//
// WHAT A MERGED SECTION SAYS, field by field:
//   * the LOADOUT chips come from one member, and every member reads identically by construction
//     of the key. Slot ORDER may differ between members; a loadout is a set and the log never
//     states an order, so the section shows the representative's order.
//   * PROVENANCE is the WEAKEST member's (`inferred` < `who` < `user`) — a section half of which
//     is inference must not wear a `stated by /who` chip. That is why `interval` is the weakest
//     member rather than the earliest.
//   * the SPAN is the union, drawn as earliest start → latest end AND the number of ranges it
//     took (`spansText`, ClassComboLabels.ts): a merged span has holes in it, and drawing it as
//     one continuous range would claim hours the loadout was not running.
//   * the LEVEL RANGE is the hull [min levelLo, max levelHi] over the members. Each member's
//     range is already min-of-loadout (shared/classCombo.ts — your level is the loadout's, and
//     the interval records the levels OBSERVED inside it), so the union is a HULL: a level inside
//     it that no member observed was never observed. It is carried as data; nothing on this
//     surface draws it, and the surface that does draw level ranges (the Profile tab's interval
//     list) is per-interval and untouched.
// A SECTION HEADER IS A CLAIM ABOUT A KILL, SO IT ANSWERS TO THE CONFIDENCE GATE (JOS-239). The
// owner's roster showed Lord Nagafen defeated at D4 under a crisp `ENC / WIZ / MNK` header; his
// wizard was level 25 and had never been in the zone. The interval behind it already carried
// `overDetermined` and a level range of 11-50, and this layer printed the trio anyway. Now an
// interval that fails `loadoutUncertain` (shared/comboIndex.ts) is routed to ONE unresolved section
// instead of naming classes — see `UNCERTAIN_KEY` for why one and not one per span. Nothing about
// the JOIN changes: the same kills land under the same intervals, and the gate decides only what
// the header is allowed to SAY.
//
//   * the BADGES follow the rule above with one word widened — SAME SECTION rather than same
//     interval. The ticket's case, a target killed at d4 under the trio in one interval and at d0
//     under the SAME trio in a later one, is now ONE card wearing the d4 badge, which is a true
//     sentence: you killed it at d4 while running these classes. Per-kill attribution is
//     unchanged (nothing is stamped; the join still happens at read), and a run under a DIFFERENT
//     loadout is still a different section — the Lord of Ire regression, pinned in
//     tests/bossTierRuns.test.mts.
