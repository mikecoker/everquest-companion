// WHAT "DEFEATED" MEANS, PER VIEW (JOS-237) — the pure half of the roster's toolbar filters,
// split out of BossView so the one predicate this ticket is about can be pinned by a node test
// instead of only by a running app.
//
// THE DEFECT, owner-reported 2026-08-12 while release-testing: "Defeated only" filtered on
// `s.killed` in BOTH modes. That flag is the ALL-TIME one — "a kill of this target is on the
// record, at some difficulty, at some point in the app's history" — so on the THIS WEEK view the
// switch answered a question the view is not asking. A boss cleared three weeks ago and not since
// stayed on screen with five grey rungs under it, which is precisely the card a raid coordinator
// turns the switch on to get RID of: the week view exists to say what this reset week has taken.
//
// THE RULE. The two modes are two readings of one roster (BossView's `Mode`), so they get two
// readings of "defeated" and nothing else moves:
//
//   OVERALL   → `everDefeated`      — ever, at any difficulty, however long ago. Unchanged.
//   THIS WEEK → `defeatedThisWeek`  — a credited kill inside the current lockout window.
//
// ONE CLOCK, AND IT IS `lockout.ts`'s. The week reading is `tierLocks(...).length > 0` over the
// SAME `LockoutWindow` the view already computes for the ladder and the chips (useLockoutWeek →
// lockoutWindow), so the filter can never disagree with the rungs it is filtering by: a card is
// kept exactly when at least one of its five rungs is green. There is no second boundary here,
// no `Date.now()`, and no day arithmetic of its own — the reset day/hour and their sourcing are
// lockout.ts's business alone (and the analytics day/week boundary rule is the owner's, so a
// surface must never quietly grow its own).
//
// TWO GRAINS, ONE PREDICATE. A `TargetStatus` is a fold over `tiers`, and the loadout sectioning
// projects a target onto a SUBSET of its runs (loadoutGroups.ts) — so the same test applied to a
// projected card answers "did the kills THIS CARD claims take a lockout this week", which is what
// keeps the switch honest once the class-loadout sectioning splits a target into several cards.
// That is why this is a predicate over a status rather than a filter over the roster array.
