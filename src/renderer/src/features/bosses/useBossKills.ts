// useBossKills — kills module → roster boss statuses, plus the kill callback fired
// live (never for the historical baseline loaded on character load). Used by both
// BossView (cards + confetti + card flash) and App (the app-wide snackbar + the
// bossDefeat alert sound) so they share ONE definition of "a boss just died".
//
// ONE TIER OF DETECTION, since 2026-08-04:
//   - onKill — ANY roster-boss kill CREDITED TO YOU, including a repeat at the
//              same/lower tier. Confetti, card flash, snackbar, toast AND the
//              bossDefeat sound.
//
// CREDITED, not merely observed (owner, 2026-08-05). A boss that dies to a stranger
// across an open-world zone is still recorded by the kills module — the roster is a
// record of what has died, and that is a world fact. It is not YOUR kill, and the log
// says which is which: an experience line lands just before the kills you (or your
// group) are paid for. `bossStatus.bossKills` compares the CREDITED count for exactly
// that reason; every status this hook returns is unchanged.
// It used to be two: a narrower `onNewDefeat` (first kill at a new instance tier)
// carried the sound, so a repeat kill was celebrated on screen and silent in the
// ears. The owner retired that split — "every time is worth celebrating" — and
// rate-limiting now belongs to the alert's own cooldown, which fireAppSignal
// applies. See bossStatus.bossKills.
//
// The baseline problem: the first snapshot already contains every boss killed in
// the past. If we compared that against an empty `prev`, every historical kill
// would look "new" and fire confetti on launch. So we seed the baseline silently
// on the first state we see and only emit for changes after that.
