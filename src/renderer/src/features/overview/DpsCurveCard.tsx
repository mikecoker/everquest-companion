// DpsCurveCard — the Overview tab's binding of the live DPS-over-time curve.
//
// It is a THIN wrapper on purpose: the chart, its markers, its hover crosshair and every number
// on it come from `features/combat/DpsOverTime` verbatim (the ONE source rule covers the whole
// chart, not just its colors). All this file decides is the card's chrome — compact mode, the
// testid, and the sentence shown when there is nothing to draw.
//
// THE SUBJECT IS THE DPS CARD'S SUBJECT. `useOverviewCombat` pulls with no `selectedId`, so the
// engine resolves the default every tick (the open fight, else the most recent finalized one) and
// `snap.timeline` is the ring of THAT segment — by construction the same fight `fightScopeOptions`
// names in the DPS card's head row right above. The two cards therefore cannot disagree about
// which fight you are looking at, which is also why `live` is read from that same head row rather
// than re-derived here: only a genuinely open fight lets the window scroll with `now`.
