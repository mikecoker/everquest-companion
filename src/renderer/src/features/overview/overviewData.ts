// overviewData — the PURE view models behind the Overview tab's recent-drops feed.
//
// No React, no MUI, no window.eq: everything here is a function of data the caller already
// holds, so `tests/overviewData.test.mts` drives it under plain node (docs/plans/overview-tab.md
// §1.2, §8).
//
// IMPORT DISCIPLINE. VALUE imports are RELATIVE, never `@shared/*` — the alias exists only
// inside the vite build, and this module is imported by the node test runner. Type-only imports
// keep the alias because tsx erases them. Same constraint, same reason, as
// `features/mobs/mobSearch.ts:33` and `features/mobs/mobZone.ts`.
//
// The three value imports are each pure + MUI-free by their own contract:
//   isNotableKnowledge — src/shared/itemKnowledge.ts (main AND renderer share it)
//   isTradeskillOnly   — lib/itemKnowledgeView.ts (lives in lib/ precisely so the MUI-free
//                        overlay bundle can use it too)
//   itemCountKey       — lib/itemName.ts (the `+N`-stripping counting key)
//   isDestroyed        — src/shared/lootDisposition.ts (what a destroy row means to a reader)

 *

 * it does: never a flicker of a wrong claim, and never a "we checked, it's nothing" implication
