// DpsCard — "how hard am I hitting, right now", and the way down to the Combat tab.
//
// IT IS THE COMBAT TAB'S METER, COMPACT (JOS-105, owner: "the Overview tab's damage panel behaves
// differently from the Combat tab - bars are not clickable, drill does not work. It must use THE
// EXACT SAME components so behavior is identical everywhere: combat overlay = combat module =
// overview combat tab. No forked panel implementations.").
//
// What was forked, and is now gone:
//   * its own drill vocabulary (`sources | self | pet`) beside the app's `Drill` union;
//   * its own row components — a bare `Bar` with no `onClick`, so a source bar that drilled on
//     the Combat tab was INERT here, which is the defect the ticket opens with;
//   * its own call into `ownBreakdown`/`nestedRows`, reaching past the shared row builder.
// It now holds a `Drill` token, hands it to `petRows.meterPanel` like every other meter, and
// renders `MeterRows` — the same components, the same clicks, the same two levels, including the
// inline per-ability stats (crit/double/triple/miss) that expand beneath a bar (JOS-113).
//
// The card still shows DELIBERATELY LESS than the Combat tab, and that is a matter of PROPS
// (`compact`, `maxRows`) rather than of different code: one label, one headline rate, one
// supporting line, five rows. No fight selector, no timeline, no Outgoing/Incoming switch, no
// combat log. If you want any of those, that is what the link is for
// (docs/plans/overview-tab.md §3.1).
//
// IT DOES OBEY THE METER SCOPE (JOS-115). It never had a scope control and still has none — but
// "no control" used to mean "no filter", so a user who set the meters to You still saw every
// group-mate's bar on the glance card, which is the same two-surfaces-disagree defect JOS-105
// opened with. Now the one persisted preference reaches here too, through the same
// `meterScope.scopeSources`/`scopeTotals` pair the Combat tab's panel uses — including the
// headline, because a total that counts rows the list is hiding is the "aggregates lie" failure
// (law 5). The scope is STATED nowhere on this card: it is four rows tall, and the Combat tab
// one click away carries the readout and the roster popover that explain it.
//
// The drill state is CARD-LOCAL — it must never move the Combat tab's drill — but it is no longer
// UNPERSISTED (JOS-116). "Coming back to Overview always shows the glance" turned out to be a
// description of the bug rather than a design: this view unmounts on every tab switch, so a drill
// you had opened was gone the moment you looked at anything else. It now has its own remembered
// slot (`useDrillMemory('overview')`, a different key from the tab's), so the card comes back
// where you left it and the two surfaces still move independently.
//
// THE LABEL IS NOT RE-DERIVED. `fightScopeOptions(...).head.label` is the ONE place the honest
// live/last wording is decided ("Current fight (live)" while a pull is open, "Last fight — <name>"
// between pulls), and the Combat tab's head row reads the same function. A second copy of that
// sentence here is exactly the drift `scopeOptions()` exists to prevent — so this card renders it
// VERBATIM, and the two surfaces can never disagree about whether you are in a fight.
//
// Likewise the SUBJECT: the snapshot is pulled with no `selectedId`, so the engine resolves the
// default (open fight, else the most recent finalized one) — by construction the same fight the
// head row names. That identity is what makes "Open in Combat" land on the fight you were
// looking at, and why the button always sends the LIVE_SELECTION sentinel rather than a pinned
// id: the sentinel re-resolves every tick, so it follows you out of this pull and into the next.
//
// And the NUMBERS: the headline is `seg.outDps` / `seg.outTotal` — you AND your pets, the same
// aggregate the Combat tab's panel header shows. Nesting the pet changes how the rows are laid
// out, never what they sum to.
