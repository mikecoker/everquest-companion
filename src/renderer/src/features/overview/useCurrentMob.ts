// useCurrentMob — `CombatSnapshot.currentTarget` → `MobKnowledge`, without storming main.
//
// RATE LIMIT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN (docs/plans/overview-tab.md §3.2). `Encounter.lastOutTarget` is
// re-stamped on EVERY outgoing hit (combat/routing.ts), so in a multi-mob pull the current target
// flips between mobs several times a second. A naive `useEffect(…, [target.name])` would issue a
// `lookupMob` per swing — and while main answers most calls from the committed 7,866-entry
// catalog offline, an uncatalogued mob falls through to the live wiki. Scraper etiquette is a
// LAW here (AGENTS.md → Data sources), so all THREE mitigations are present and none is optional:
//
//   1. CANONICAL KEY — `mobKey` (src/shared/mobKey.ts), the SAME fold main applies before it
//      answers, so 'A Sphinx' and 'a sphinx ' are one subject and so are 'an elemental capturer'
//      and 'an elemental capturer (14)'. That seam is closed as of JOS-350; until then this was
//      an inline `trim().toLowerCase()` that could not strip the spawn-generation suffix
//      `CurrentTarget.name` carries, so a suffixed target both asked main twice for one mob and
//      never found its own consider seed (the ring's names never carry the suffix).
//   2. DEBOUNCE — mid-pull target flapping resolves to ONE lookup.
//   3. PER-KEY MEMO for the component's life — the `requested` ref discipline
//      `features/loot/useNotablePickups.ts:54` already uses, so a mob is asked for at most once.
//
// INSTANT PAINT comes from the `consider` module's ring instead: if you conned this mob, its row
// already carries enriched knowledge, exactly as `MobTarget.seed` paints MobPage before its own
// refresh lands.
