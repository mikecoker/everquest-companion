// ZoneStrip — who you are and where you are, in one line.
//
// The zone comes from the CHARACTER module, not from `CombatSnapshot.zone`. Both are the same
// fact from the same `You have entered X.` line, but the character module is the designated
// "who am I / where am I" owner and it arrives over the delta transport rather than a poll
// (docs/plans/overview-tab.md §3.3).
//
// THE ZONE STRING IS RENDERED RAW (law 2 — canonicalize at boundaries, display raw). The
// instance-tier decoder (`zoneTier` / `TIER_LABELS`) lives in `src/main/log/parseWorld.ts` and is
// main-only; the renderer must not import from `src/main` and must not re-implement it. A tier
// chip here is a clean follow-up that STARTS by moving those two into `src/shared/` — explicitly
// not done here.
//
// IT IS A HEADER BAND, NOT A CARD (visual-hierarchy sweep, 2026-08-03). A border is the app's
// CARD level, and wearing one here made the Overview read as four peer boxes when it is really
// one header plus three cards. So the strip differentiates by a subtle fill on the same surface
// the cards use, with no outline of its own — the cards below keep the only borders on the page.
// (Fill is `background.paper`, not the `background.default` an INSIDE-a-card recess would use:
// this strip sits on the page background, which IS `background.default`, so that token would be
// invisible here and `action.hover` would read brighter than the cards it introduces.)
