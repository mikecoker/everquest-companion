// overviewLevelingData — the PURE view model behind the Overview tab's leveling card.
//
// No React, no MUI, no window.eq: one function of the `progression` snapshot the hook already
// holds, so `tests/overviewLeveling.test.mts` drives every rule here under plain node.
//
// IMPORT DISCIPLINE (same as overviewData.ts): VALUE imports are RELATIVE, never `@shared/*` —
// that alias exists only inside the vite build and the node test runner would not resolve it.
// Type-only imports keep the alias because tsx erases them.
//
// TWO WINDOWS, AND WHY THEY ARE THESE TWO
//
//   A — "last hour": `[lastTs - 60min, lastTs]`. Anchored on the DATA'S CLOCK, never
//       `Date.now()`. The distinction is the whole point: this app is read by someone who
//       alt-tabbed out of EverQuest, and a wall-clock window would hand them an empty hour
//       and a fabricated "0.00 lvl/hr" the moment they stopped playing. Anchored on `lastTs`
//       the card answers "how was the last hour I actually played", which is the question.
//
//   B — "this zone": `[start of the last zone interval, lastTs]`. The camp you are in right
//       now, however long you have been in it — the number you compare against window A to
//       decide whether to stay. Absent when the snapshot holds no zone line at all (a log
//       whose replay has not reached one yet), and that absence is a state, not an error:
//       the card simply omits the line rather than inventing a zone.
//
// EVERY UNKNOWN IS AN EM-DASH (rangeStatsRows rule 1, reused here rather than restated). A
// levels rate is null when the window has no active time AND when every experience line in it
// stated no percentage — the at-cap case, which this card chips as `at cap`. Printing '0.00'
// for either would be a fabricated measurement.
//
// VOCABULARY: "levels of progress", never "xp" (the log states a percentage of the CURRENT
// level's bar and nothing else). Silence is "idle", never "AFK" — see `idleRuleCaption`.
//
// OFFLINE TIME IS NOT IDLE TIME, AND NEITHER IS ACTIVITY
//
//   Window A is an hour of LOG time, and an hour of log time can contain a logout: play until
//   02:52, camp, come back at 13:00, and `[lastTs - 60min, lastTs]` may be mostly an empty
//   chair. Every number on this card handles that the same way — the hours the log says you
//   were logged out are taken OUT of the denominator rather than counted as bad hours:
//
//     • the headline rate was always over ACTIVE time and is unchanged;
//     • the projection divides by the window's ONLINE wall rate (`levelsPerHourWall`, whose
//       denominator is `durationMs - offlineMs`), so an overnight in the window no longer
//       drags the ETA toward infinity;
//     • the per-level history subtracts the same intervals from each completed level, so the
//       comparison is online-against-online rather than a pace that quietly beats a median
//       full of sleep;
//     • and when the window has too little online play left to project from, the estimate is
//       REFUSED with a reason (`ETA_MIN_ONLINE_MS`) instead of quoted from a five-minute
//       sample. An ETA over a window that was 90% logged out was arithmetic, not a prediction.
//
//   The honesty limit rides along unchanged: a logout is derived only from the LOGIN line that
//   ended it, so an absence in progress is invisible and its silence stays "idle". No wording
//   on this card says offline unless an interval was actually derived.
//
// THE PROJECTION (owner request: "predict next level timing at the same level of activity")
//
//   The log NEVER states where you are in the level bar. It states a percentage PER GAIN, and
//   nothing else — no total, no remainder, no bar position. So the only way to know how far
//   into the current bar you are is to add up every stated percentage SINCE THE LAST DING, and
//   that sum is trustworthy only when nothing is missing from it. Four things can make it
//   untrustworthy, and each one KILLS the estimate rather than degrading it (law 1: anything
//   inferred is labeled, and a projection built on a guessed bar position is not labelable —
//   it is just wrong):
//
//     • no ding has been observed at all ⇒ there is no anchor to sum from;
//     • an at-cap line (no percentage stated) landed since the ding ⇒ a hole in the sum;
//     • the retention floor has risen past the ding ⇒ dropped samples, a hole in the sum;
//     • the last hour states no pace at all ⇒ nothing to project with.
//
//   Those four are about the SUM. A fifth gate is about the WINDOW — see the offline section
//   below: an hour that was mostly a logout has too little play left in it to project from.
//
//   With all of them clear the estimate is `remaining fraction / the last hour's WALL rate`.
//   WALL, not active: the user asked when they will level, and they will experience that in
//   wall time, including the same proportion of medding and looting the last hour already
//   contained. (That denominator is ONLINE wall — the hours the log says you were logged out
//   are excluded, because you will not experience those either.) The ACTIVE rate gates it (that
//   is the honest "were you actually playing" signal) but the WALL rate divides. The tooltip
//   states every assumption verbatim, and the `~` is real: this is a projection of one hour
//   forward, never a countdown to a known instant.
//
// THE COMPARISON is the same discipline applied backwards: time-per-level for the last few
// dings, read off `levelTs`/`levelValue` — which are UNCAPPED, so unlike everything else here
// they cannot be clipped. It NEVER crosses a run boundary. EQ Legends gives one level to a
// three-class loadout and swapping a class in drops the level with NO log line of any kind, so
// the span across that drop covers time the log cannot account for. `progressionStats` splits
// runs on exactly that rule (a value below the previous one opens a new run) and so does this.
//
// AA IS THE READ THAT SURVIVES THE CAP. Every number above is built on stated level-bar
// percentages, and at max level the game stops stating them — so the headline goes to an
// em-dash and the `at cap` chip exactly when the character starts caring about AA instead. The
// AA line (`aaLine` below) is the answer that keeps working: completions per hour, points per
// hour, and the inferred wait for the next one, all over the SAME window A the headline used.
// It reuses the Leveling tab's own shaping (`aaPaceLine`) rather than re-wording the numbers,
// and it is ABSENT — not em-dashed — for a window holding no completion, which is every window
// a character not earning AA will ever have. Nothing else on the card changes shape because of
// it: below the cap this reads exactly as it always did, plus one line whenever AA arrived.
