// CursorRingSetting — Preferences → Cursor ring.
//
// A thick circle that follows the mouse, drawn ONLY over the EverQuest window (owner request:
// "I lose my mouse on EQ screens"). Off by default; the toggle is the only thing that makes it
// exist. It is white until the player picks another colour (JOS-125), and the default is the
// old colour exactly, so nobody's ring changes by upgrading.
//
// THE NOTE ABOUT SCOPE IS NOT DECORATION. "Only over EverQuest" is the single most surprising
// thing about this feature — a user who turns it on while reading Preferences sees nothing
// happen, and without that line would reasonably conclude it is broken. It states WHERE the
// ring is, which is state, not process.
//
// Every control here is live: main pushes the whole blob to the ring window on every write
// (presenceEffects.refreshPresenceEffects), so dragging a slider resizes the halo under the
// pointer, and picking a colour recolours it, instead of on the next restart.
//
// ONE BORDER: PreferencesView wraps each item in an outlined Paper, so this renders bare Stacks.

 * its colour is a picker, so a user with a fat red ring opened this section, saw a thin white one

 * preview that shrank while the labels beside it grew would read as broken, and the number the

 * the ticket was about, is fixed at the window that draws it.
