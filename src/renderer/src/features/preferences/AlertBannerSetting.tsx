// AlertBannerSetting — Preferences → Overlays → "Alert banner" (JOS-378).
//
// FOUR controls over one window: is it on, where does it sit, how long a line stays, and how many
// lines fit. (The fifth knob — text size — is on the banner's own frame, because that frame is the
// only chrome this kind ever shows and a size control that lived here would be sizing something
// you cannot see. The toast card next door makes the same choice for the same reason.)
//
// ON/OFF IS THE WINDOW'S OPEN-STATE. There is no second `enabled` flag: the banner is an overlay
// kind, so "on" means its window is open, persisted and restored exactly like every other
// overlay's. Two switches for one state is how they drift.
//
// SEEDED FROM THE PANE'S SNAPSHOT, LIKE EVERY OTHER CARD (JOS-340). The first cut of this card
// mounted on the shipped defaults (OFF, locked, the default hold and lines) and corrected itself
// from main a beat later, on the argument that this kind ships DISABLED so the defaults are the
// honest guess for most installs. That argument was exactly wrong for the person it matters to:
// anyone who has turned the banner ON watched the switch paint OFF and rise on every visit to
// this section (owner, hands-on, 2026-08-16). "Most installs" is not the law; the law is that a
// control never paints a value it does not know, and the snapshot (./prefsHydration.tsx) exists
// so that no card has to guess. So this card seeds from `usePrefsSeed().alertBanner` and there is
// no first frame to be wrong in.
//
// STATE, NEVER PROCESS (the repo's UI law): every caption says what is true now, not how the
// window is implemented. Nothing here mentions click-through, IPC or queues.

 * close itself, so the switch listens rather than trusting what it started with. There is no
