// BuffTrustSetting — Preferences → Buffs → "Track other casters" (JOS-140).
//
// ONE LIST OF NAMES, and the shortest surface that can express the rule the owner asked for. The
// buff and debuff bars only ever show spells a CAST LINE anchors, and the only cast lines that are
// yours say "You begin casting". A player who duos with the same enchanter every night wants that
// enchanter's mez timers on their debuff window; the honest way to give it to them is to let them
// NAME the person, because the game's landing sentences name nobody.
//
// STATE, NEVER PROCESS (the repo's UI law): this is a list you edit, not a scan you run. There is
// deliberately no "add everyone in my group" button and no suggestion from the roster — a group
// changes without the user choosing it, and this preference is a choice. The caption says what the
// empty state means rather than leaving it to be inferred, because "why do I not see their buffs"
// is the question this control exists to answer.
//
// ONE BORDER: PreferencesView already wraps each item in an outlined Paper, so this renders bare
// Stacks.

 * being what was actually stored after the shared normalizer had its say.
 *
 * It used to mount on `DEFAULT_BUFF_TRUST_PREFS` — the EMPTY allowlist — and correct itself
 * (JOS-340), so a user with three trusted casters opened this section to a card that said they
 * trusted nobody, and then watched their own list appear. Of every field in the pane this was the
