// TelemetrySetting — Preferences → Usage analytics (docs/plans/usage-analytics.md T3 + T4).
//
// Three controls and one window onto the truth:
//
//   * THE SWITCH. Off stops collection AND drops everything already buffered, immediately. The
//     caption says so, because a switch that quietly left 500 events on disk would be lying.
//   * ROTATE. A new anonymous id, and the buffer goes with it. That deliberately severs the
//     retention chain — a rotated id is a brand-new cohort member, which is a real cost and is
//     stated rather than buried.
//   * THE PAYLOAD VIEWER (T4: "show the payload"). The live buffer and the last batch sent, as
//     JSON, verbatim. Not a summary of it, not a description of it — the bytes. It is the only
//     claim about privacy that a user can check for themselves, which is why it exists.
//
// AND IT IS HONEST ABOUT WHICH SILENCE IT IS SHOWING. An empty "last batch sent" panel means
// two very different things — this install has not sent yet, or this build cannot send at all —
// and the pane says which rather than rendering an empty box the user has to interpret. The
// copy is chosen from `endpointConfigured`: the component reads the fact, it does not assume
// it, which is why lighting the endpoint changed no code here.
//
// ONE BORDER: PreferencesView wraps each item in an outlined Paper, so this renders bare Stacks.

 * is a PRIVACY switch, and "Loading…" where a user expects to read whether they are opted out is
 * the one place in this app that should never hesitate.

 * THE POLL STAYS. The buffer grows from main, which has no push channel for it (and should not
 * gain one for a settings pane nobody watches for minutes), so the seed is a starting point and
 * the interval keeps it honest. Every read it takes goes back into the snapshot, so re-opening
 * the section starts from the newest counts rather than from the ones the pane first loaded.
