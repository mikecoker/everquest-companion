// TelemetryNotice — the first-run usage-analytics notice (docs/plans/usage-analytics.md T1).
//
// THE ONE THING THIS COMPONENT IS FOR: nothing may ever be transmitted before a user has been
// TOLD. Analytics is opt-OUT here (the owner's decision, taken over the integrator's opt-in
// recommendation), and opt-out is only honest if the telling comes first. So the network gate in
// main (`telemetryFlushEnabled`) requires `noticeShown`, and this bar is the only thing that
// sets it.
//
// IT IS A SLIM BOTTOM BAR, NOT A MODAL (T1 amended 2026-08-04 by the owner). The first thing a
// new user meets should be the app, not a consent wall — so this is one sentence and three
// controls along the bottom edge, and the explanation lives where someone who wants it will
// look for it: Preferences → Usage analytics, and TELEMETRY.md. A modal that has to be read
// before the app can be used buys agreement, not understanding.
//
// THE RULES IT OBEYS, each of which is a way this pattern is usually done badly:
//
//   * OPT OUT IS A BUTTON, not a footnote. "Details" is the small link; the action that costs
//     the app something is the one rendered plainly.
//   * DISMISSAL KEEPS IT ON. That is what opt-out means, and it is the same answer as
//     "Details" — both mark the notice shown and leave collection running.
//   * IT IS SHOWN ONCE, EVER — the flag flips on every one of the three exits, so a user who
//     opts out is not asked again either.
//   * IT DOES NOT MOVE THE APP. A Snackbar is fixed-position and portalled, so the bar floats
//     over the bottom of the content area: no reflow, and nothing above it (title bar, nav,
//     the separate overlay windows) is touched.
//
// Mounted from App.tsx, unconditionally: it reads the prefs itself and renders nothing at all
// once `noticeShown` is true, which is every launch after the first.
