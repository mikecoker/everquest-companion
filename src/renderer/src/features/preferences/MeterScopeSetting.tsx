// WHOSE DAMAGE THE METERS SHOW — the Combat section's second card (JOS-115).
//
// It used to be a chip on every combat surface: one on the Combat tab's lens line, one on each
// floating overlay's header row, each writing its own key. The owner's reading was that a
// three-state selector repeated on every surface is clutter answering a question you set once
// ("the You / Group / Everyone meter SOURCE-scope control is shown INLINE on every combat surface
// and is too crowded"), so it is ONE preference now, written here and read by the Combat tab, the
// Overview damage card and every floating meter (features/combat/useCombatPrefs.useMeterScope).
//
// A SEGMENTED CONTROL, NOT A CYCLE. The overlay's chip was a cycle because a two-inch pinned
// window has room for one word; a preferences card has room for three, and three visible options
// with the chosen one lit is the shape that says what the alternatives even are.
//
// The DESCRIPTION under it is the selected scope's own sentence out of shared/roster.ts — the one
// phrasing every surface's tooltip already uses, so this card cannot drift from what the meters
// say about themselves. The Group row carries one extra line, because its no-roster fallback is
// the single thing about this setting a user is most likely to be confused by: an empty roster
// makes Group render as Everyone (law 1 — unknown must never hide people), and the meters label
// themselves `Group (no roster yet)` while it does. That line matters MORE since JOS-229 made
// Everyone the default, not less: Group is now something a user reaches for deliberately, and the
// sentence explains why the meter they just narrowed may not look narrowed yet.
//
// It is a SEPARATE FILE from PreferencesView.tsx for the reason PerfSetting and GraphicsSetting
// are: that file sits at the 400-code-line factoring ceiling, and the answer there is to split.
