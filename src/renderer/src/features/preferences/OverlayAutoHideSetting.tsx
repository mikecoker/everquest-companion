// OverlayAutoHideSetting — Preferences → Overlays.
//
// Two independent switches over one question: when should the floating meters get out of the
// way? They are deliberately NOT one three-state mode, because they are not two points on a
// scale — "don't leave meters floating over my desktop when I'm not playing" is housekeeping
// almost everyone wants, while "vanish every time I alt-tab" is a taste many people actively
// don't share (you alt-tab TO read the numbers).
//
// STATE, NEVER PROCESS (the repo's UI law): the captions say what happens and what the current
// setting means. Nothing here mentions the watcher, the poll, or the process check — the user
// asked for overlays that behave, not for a description of how the app looks at Windows.
//
// ONE BORDER: PreferencesView already wraps each item in an outlined Paper, so this renders bare
// Stacks — a Paper here would draw a second frame inside the first.
//
// HIDE, NEVER CLOSE, and the copy says so: an auto-hidden overlay keeps its position, its lock
// state and its drill-down, and the TitleBar menu still lists it as open. That is the difference
// between a setting and a surprise.
//
// "NOT IN EVERQUEST" INCLUDES THIS APP (JOS-199). The caption used to promise the opposite — "this
// app's own windows don't count" — which a player reported as the bug it was: the meters sat on top
// of the Companion while they were trying to read it. The OVERLAYS still don't count (clicking one
// must not make it vanish under your cursor); the main window does.

/**
 * The prefs blob, SEEDED from the pane's hydration snapshot and written back on every change.
 *
 * IT USED TO MOUNT ON `DEFAULT_OVERLAY_AUTO_HIDE` AND CORRECT ITSELF (JOS-340), which is the
 * flicker the owner reported — and this card is the worst case of it in the pane, because its two
 * defaults point OPPOSITE ways: `hideWhenNotRunning` ships `true`, so a user who turned it off
 * watched it paint ON and drop; `hideWhenUnfocused` ships `false`, so a user who turned it on
 * watched it paint OFF and rise. The starting value now comes out of the snapshot the gate already
 * has in hand (./prefsHydration.tsx), synchronously, so there is no first frame to be wrong in.
 *
 * Writes are unchanged: optimistic locally (a switch must not lag an IPC round trip) and
 * authoritative from main's reply, which is what was actually stored — and that reply is what goes
 * back into the snapshot, so the next mount of this card seeds from the same truth.
