// planner/plannerPreset.ts — WHICH ITEM IS THE BROWSER NARROWED TO.
//
// The planner had one way in: pick an effect, then say which slot it lands in. The owner asked for
// the other one, which is how the game itself presents the decision — you name an item and you see
// what can legally go in it. JOS-210 opened two doors onto that one narrowing, and JOS-326 closed
// the first of them:
//
//   * THE INVENTORY TAB'S `BrowsePreset` — a cell, one of its four sockets, and the host that cell
//     was wearing — IS GONE with the plan board it was a message from. Its whole apparatus went
//     with it: the exact-key lookup that turned a dump-filled host name into slots and classes, the
//     merge that let a preset outrank a hand-picked item, and the cell the focus used to carry.
//   * THE FILTER BAR'S OWN ITEM PICKER remains, and it was always the wider of the two: it reaches
//     ANY item the committed DB carries rather than only the ones a set already hosted, which was
//     the whole of the owner's ask. It is now the only way a focus is set, so an `ItemFocus` is
//     simply what the user picked.
//
// AND THE FOCUS SURVIVES A KIND SWITCH (JOS-210, the bug half), now by construction rather than by
// arrangement: the picked item is its own state in EffectBrowser and no filter-bar write touches
// it, so "show me this item's worn effects instead of its procs" cannot throw the item away.

 * CAN THIS DONOR'S EFFECT MOVE INTO THIS ITEM? — R2 and R3, asked as a FILTER.

 * The rule itself is `socketCompatibility` (shared/planner/rules.ts) and is not restated here: it
 * owns R3's flat no on haste and R2's slot half, and passing it an EMPTY class list is how this
 * file asks for those two alone. The class half is then `classesMismatch`, which is the one rule
 * the browser filter and the Board's mismatch chip already share.
 *
 * WHY THE CLASS HALF IS ASKED SEPARATELY: `socketCompatibility` answers for a PLANNED socket, where
 * an unknown must be reported rather than passed ("this page states no class list"). A browser
 * filter has the opposite obligation — hiding every donor whose page stayed silent would assert a
 * fact the wiki declined to state (law 1) — so an unknown on either side passes here and the row is
 * chipped instead.
 *
 * An item with NO STATED SLOTS narrows nothing rather than matching nothing: the filter bar's
 * picker only ever offers items that state one, so this arm is unreachable from the UI and exists
 * so a gap in our own data can never blank the browser.
