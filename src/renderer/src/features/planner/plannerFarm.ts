// planner/plannerFarm.ts — a list of wanted items, turned into a route: what is still missing, and
// where it is.
//
// This is the arithmetic that was behind Farm mode (design §5.4), kept out of the view so the
// interesting part is one pure function over plain data. JOS-326 removed the Farm TAB and the plan
// board that fed it; the arithmetic is untouched and is now aimed at the WISH LIST
// (features/wishlist/wishFarm.ts collects the needs, this file groups them). That re-aim is the
// reason `FarmNeed` no longer names a plan CELL: a wish is flat by owner ruling, and every rule
// below — the primary zone, the "also:" tail, the four non-zone headings, the era override — only
// ever read a need's ZONES, its SOURCES and its donor row.
//
// WHY A DONOR IS LISTED UNDER ONE ZONE AND NOT ALL OF THEM. Roughly a third of donors drop in
// several zones, and listing each under every zone turns a route into a concordance: eight
// headings, the same four items under each, no idea where to actually go. So every donor is
// assigned to ONE primary zone — the zone that holds the most of THIS SET'S other needs — and
// keeps an "also" note naming the rest. The rollup then reads the way the feature was asked for:
// "go to Lower Guk, it feeds four sockets."
//
// Ties break ALPHABETICALLY, not by catalog order. Two zones that feed the same number of needs
// are equally good answers, and a stable, statable rule beats "whichever the scrape listed first"
// — a rescrape must never silently re-route the list.
//
// …AND THE ERA COMES FIRST, ABOVE BOTH (JOS-42, owner-reported 2026-08-06). Batfang Headband was
// filed under DRAGON NECROPOLIS — Velious, which this server has not opened — with Western Plains
// of Karana, where four classic-era ogres drop it, demoted to the muted "also:" tail. Nothing in
// the arithmetic was wrong: the three zones each fed one need, and the alphabetical tiebreak
// picked the first. But the heading a farm route prints is a place you are being told to GO, and
// a rollup that sends you somewhere unreachable is not a smaller answer than the right one — it
// is a wrong one, and it costs the whole surface its credibility.
//
// So with the era filter on, the primary zone is chosen from the IN-ERA zones whenever there are
// any, and the weights and the alphabetical tiebreak then decide among those. Out-of-era zones
// still appear — in the "also:" tail, each naming its own expansion, because "you could also camp
// this in Velious, later" is real knowledge and deleting it would be its own kind of lie. When NO
// zone is in era the candidate set is every zone again, which is the pre-existing behaviour: such
// a donor is out-of-era wholesale and the filter has already hidden it (FarmList), or the filter
// is off and the user has asked to see everything.
//
// THE FOUR NON-ZONE HEADINGS ARE HONEST STATES, NOT LEFTOVERS. A quest reward and a crafted item
// have no camp; a mob whose page states no home zone is a real camp with an unstated address; a
// donor with no source at all is a fact about our knowledge, not about the game. Each says which
// one it is rather than being dropped into a zone we invented.

/**
 * ONE WANTED ITEM, resolved against the corpus, the catalog and your own progress.
 *
 * `id` is the row's identity for React and for "every need appears exactly once" — the wish's
 * `itemKey`. It is a field rather than an implied composite because the shape used to be keyed by
 * `slot:socket:donorKey` and a flat list has no such tuple.
 *
 * THE EFFECT CONTEXT IS OPTIONAL, and that is the whole difference between the two kinds of wish.
 * A DONOR wish is wanted FOR an effect: it names the effect, the socket it occupies and therefore
 * the merge tier the effect extracts at, and the row states the cost of getting there. A GEAR wish
 * is wanted for itself: it names none of the three, and the row correctly says nothing about
 * merging (law 1 — silence, never a guessed tier).
 *
 * IT IS SELF-DESCRIBING, WHICH IS WHAT LETS TWO INDICES FEED IT. The need used to carry the
 * `DonorRow` the effect corpus answered with, and every reader reached through it for the item's
 * classes, slots, era witnesses and quest/crafted flags. A wish can equally be answered by the
 * GEAR index — different row type, same five facts — so the collector reads whichever index
 * knows and copies the facts here. Nothing downstream has to know which one spoke.
