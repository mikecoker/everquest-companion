// planner/PlannerChips.tsx — the planner's shared atoms: the state chip, the era chip, the
// no-slot chip, and a donor NAME that links.
//
// ONE CHIP PER SOCKET (UI conventions: chips convey STATE, never process). The Inventory cell and
// the Farm row show the same four states in the same colours, so a socket you looked at on the
// Inventory tab is recognisable in the rollup without re-reading it.
//
// THE DONOR NAME CLICKS (owner, 2026-08-04) — it is the app's standing link idiom (`openLoot`,
// appRouting): it takes the Loot tab over with that item's drill-down.
//
// IT NO LONGER HOVERS (JOS-143), and that is the same removal JOS-127 made on the Loot ledger.
// The name used to anchor `KnownItemTooltip` (lib/): a `placement="top"`, up-to-380px, INTERACTIVE
// card that holds `pointer-events: auto` for as long as it is up. Donor names are ROWS, and on
// both planner surfaces the rows sit directly under a toolbar full of dropdowns — the Effects
// browser's Slot and Group by selects (EffectFilterBar) and the board's Classes chip-select
// (PlannerView). A card opened from the first row of either list lands on those controls and eats
// the clicks aimed at them. `placement="top"` is what aims it there; removal, not a flip, is the
// owner's direction. The click survives, and it goes somewhere strictly better: the drill-down
// states the item window AND what the committed DBs know (ItemDbSources, below).
//
// WHY THE DRILL-DOWN IS NOW A FAIR DESTINATION. It used to be exactly the wrong one — its "Dropped
// by / Zones" columns were built from OBSERVED loot events alone, so a donor you have never looted
// answered "Times looted 0 · No source recorded" one click after a planner row told you which mob
// in which zone drops it. That contradiction is what `features/loot/ItemDbSources.tsx` closes: the
// drill now also states what the committed DBs know, labelled `db` beside the `observed` columns.
// With both witnesses on screen, the deep link is a promotion, not a downgrade.
//
// THE FIVE STATE CHIPS LOST THEIRS TOO (JOS-143). They are default-placement, so they open DOWN
// rather than onto a toolbar — but they render on the SAME rows as the donor name, and a file that
// is half popper-free is a file whose rule cannot be stated or guarded. Every sentence is a native
// title now, which is what these chips wanted all along: one word on screen, the explanation on
// hover, and nothing in the DOM that can take a click.
