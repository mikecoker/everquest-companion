// The Timers tab's data seam (JOS-194): the respawn module's snapshot, plus the one-second clock
// every countdown on the page reads.
//
// THE CLOCK IS LOCAL AND THERE IS EXACTLY ONE OF IT. A row carries its own `diedTs` and its own
// `estimateMs`, so a countdown needs no IPC at all — the buffs overlay's arrangement
// (`useSecondsClock`), for the same reason: a ticking number that travels over IPC is a message
// per second per row for a value the renderer can compute. One interval, threaded down as a
// prop, is also what keeps every row on the page agreeing about what time it is (world-model law
// 9's "one time base per chart", one floor down).
