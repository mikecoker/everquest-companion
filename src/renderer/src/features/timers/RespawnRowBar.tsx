// One respawn clock, drawn (JOS-194). Used by the Timers tab; the floating overlay draws the same
// facts with plain divs because that bundle is MUI-free, and both surfaces take the clock's
// WORDING and the provenance line from `shared/respawn.ts` rather than spelling either twice.
//
// WHAT THE ROW IS CAREFUL ABOUT. It never says the mob is up FROM A CLOCK. `due` means the estimate
// elapsed, the label says "due" and not "spawned", and the provenance line under the name states
// which rung of the ladder produced the number and how thin the evidence is ("your kills (2 gaps)").
// A countdown with no provenance is a countdown the user has to trust blindly, and the whole
// argument of this feature is that the number the wiki would have given them does not deserve
// that (shared/respawnWiki.ts).
//
// AND IT SAYS ALL OF THAT IN LABELS (owner ruling, round 5: too much explanatory text). Rounds 1-4
// each left a sentence behind on this row — what a gap proves, what the floor did, what a sighting
// does not prove — until the row was three lines of prose under a countdown. Every one of those
// facts now lives on the HOVER (`respawnProvenance`, in shared/respawn.ts so the floating window's
// native title is the same string) and the row itself prints only state: the name, the number, the
// rung, the zone, and the age of any sighting.
//
// THE ONE PLACE IT DOES SAY UP IS WHEN THE LOG SAID SO (owner ruling, round 3). A row whose mob has
// been named by a parsed event since its clock started reads UP, in a colour used nowhere else on
// this surface, with the age of that evidence and the family of line that carried it printed
// underneath. That is not the clock changing its mind — the countdown, the bar and the provenance
// are all still there — it is the row leading with the fact instead of the estimate.
//
// AND THE RE-BASE IS A BUTTON, NEVER A RULE. A sighting proves the mob is up and says nothing about
// when it spawned, so nothing here moves the clock on its own. The button appears only on a seen
// row, says what it will do, and is the only path to `basis: 'sighting'` — which the row then
// states out loud, because a number resting on the user's judgement must never look like one
// resting on a line the game printed.
//
// AND THE HOVER IS NOW THE MOB'S CARD (owner ruling, round 6). A countdown says when; the question
// a player standing on a spawn point is asking is whether to keep standing there, which is a
// question about loot. So pointing at a row reveals the SAME card the `/con` hover has always
// drawn — the wiki drop table with your own loot counts riding on it, and anything only your
// history knows underneath — with round 5's provenance sentence as its leading block. No second
// drops source, no second card, and the sentence is still the one string both surfaces read.
//
// AND THE ROW CARRIES ITS OWN WAY OUT (owner ruling, round 4). Every row here is a mob the user
// asked for by name, so the question "do I still want this clock" is asked AT the clock — not by
// scrolling to a list at the bottom of the page and matching a name against it, which is where the
// only unwatch used to live. It is the same control the Recently-killed entry offers, so the mob
// reads the same wherever you meet it.
//
// AND ROUND 7 FINISHED THAT MOVE. "Your watches" — the list at the bottom of the tab that round 4
// left standing — is gone, so the OTHER thing it held came here too: rung 1 of the ladder, the
// number that outranks everything this app learned. It is on the row because that is where the
// player is standing when they decide the number is wrong.
//
// AND ROUND 9 CHANGED ITS SHAPE (owner ruling — this SUPERSEDES round 7's bare seconds box, which is
// deleted rather than hidden). Three things happened to this row and they are one idea:
//
//   * THE DURATION AND ITS SOURCE ARE ONE THING. They used to sit at opposite ends of the same line,
//     which reads as two facts sharing a row rather than as a fact and its provenance. They are now
//     one bordered unit — `respawnDurationText` and `respawnSourceLabel` inside one box — so a
//     glance reads "9m 30s, from the wiki".
//   * THE EDIT AFFORDANCE IS ATTACHED TO THAT UNIT, because it edits that unit and nothing else, and
//     it is an ICON: a text field on a 30px countdown row was the whole of what was wrong with the
//     seconds box. It opens `RespawnEditDialog`, which is where the evidence and the decision finally
//     meet.
//   * AN OVERRULED ROW IS IN A STATE. `respawnOverridden` is the one definition (`source === 'custom'`)
//     and this surface paints it in the theme's gold on that same unit — so a camp's worth of clocks
//     tells you at a glance which numbers are yours. The floating window paints the same state in its
//     own palette and carries none of the editing.
//
// AND THE ROW EXISTS EVEN WHEN THE CLOCK IS LONG GONE (owner ruling, round 8). A watched mob always
// has a row, so this component now draws one whose estimate elapsed hours ago — and it must not do
// that by shouting. A STALE row says the honest thing instead of a number that grows forever
// (`respawnClockLabel`: "due long ago", or "awaiting next death" where there was never an estimate),
// drops the progress bar because there is no estimate left running to draw, and goes grey so the
// clock actually ticking in front of you is still the loudest thing on the page. Everything else on
// it is unchanged: the hover, the gaps, the seconds box and Unwatch are all still there, because the
// row is still a mob the user is watching.
//
// AND THE ROW SHOWS ITS WORKING. Under the countdown it now prints the GAPS this fold measured for
// this mob in this zone — the samples `<= 3m 00s` is the minimum of — newest first. They are not a
// new claim and not a new source: the same numbers, un-minimised, said plainly, so "where did that
// estimate come from" is answerable without opening the hover. What they are NOT is spawns
// observed; see `respawnGapsLabel` in shared/respawn.ts for why that wording is load-bearing.
