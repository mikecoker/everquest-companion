// useFocusLanding — WHERE A LEVEL-UP TOAST'S DEEP LINK ACTUALLY PUTS YOU (JOS-330).
//
// THE LINK WAS TRUE AND THE ARRIVAL WAS SILENT. Clicking "Level 24!" on the celebration overlay
// has always mounted the Leveling tab with `NewAtLevelPanel` anchored at 24 (the focusLevel /
// focusNonce contract, docs/plans/levelup-whats-new.md §2 and appRouting.ts's nonce law). Since
// JOS-300 that panel sits at the BOTTOM of the left column on a page-tall view, so what the reader
// actually saw was the top of a tab full of charts, with the thing they clicked for a screen and a
// half below the fold and nothing saying so. A link that lands you in the right ROOM is not the
// same as a link that lands you on the thing.
//
// So a landing is two moves, and this hook owns both because they share one trigger and one clock:
//
//   1. SCROLL IT INTO THE ONE SCROLLER. `[data-testid="app-content"]` is the only scroller between
//      a view and the window (JOS-289), which is exactly why the move can be a plain
//      `scrollIntoView` on the panel: with nothing else scrolling, "scroll the panel into the
//      content area" and "scroll the panel into view" are the same sentence. The ancestor is found
//      with `closest`, never `querySelector`, so this measures the box the panel is actually in.
//
//   2. LIGHT IT. A brief gold pulse on the panel's own edge, held for `LANDING_HIGHLIGHT_MS` and
//      then gone — the PrefSectionBlock arrival pulse's reasoning applied to a second surface: the
//      user clicked a sentence in one window and got a tab in another, and the highlight is the
//      only thing connecting the two ends. Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` the animation is
//      replaced by a static outline held for the same interval, so the INFORMATION survives even
//      when the movement must not.
//
// THE SCROLL WAITS FOR LAYOUT, AND IT WAITS ON REACT RATHER THAN ON FRAMES. The panel's own
// content arrives after mount (`useLevelUnlocks` is an IPC pull) and the charts above it render
// from a module snapshot, so a single scroll fired at consumption time aims at a layout that is
// about to change under it. The obvious fix — a `requestAnimationFrame` settle loop — is the wrong
// one HERE: AGENTS.md records rAF being throttled to roughly nothing in a never-composited window,
// which is every e2e launch, so a frame-driven landing would be both slower and untestable. The
// cheap, honest signal is React's own: every commit that could have moved this panel re-renders it
// (LevelingView hands it a fresh props object), so the corrective scroll rides an effect with NO
// dependency array and simply runs after each commit while a landing is in flight. It re-aims only
// when the panel is not already fully inside the content box, so a settled layout costs one
// `getBoundingClientRect` per render for two seconds and nothing else.
//
// THE HIGHLIGHT DOES NOT WAIT FOR THE SCROLL, deliberately. The two are decoupled so a slow layout
// can never eat the cue — the pulse starts the instant the link is consumed and expires on its own
// clock, whatever the scroll is still chasing.
//
// AND IT RE-FIRES ON A REPEAT OF THE SAME LEVEL, which is the entire reason the nonce exists.
// Ding at 24 twice and the second card must land you exactly as the first did. That is why `seq`
// carries the NONCE rather than a boolean: `NewAtLevelPanel` keys the pulse element on it, so a
// repeat mounts a new element and the CSS animation restarts from zero instead of being ignored as
// an unchanged style. A plain tab switch (`openLeveling()` with no level, Overview's card) bumps
// the same nonce with `armed` false and must do neither thing — it cancels any landing in flight
// rather than starting one, because nothing sent the reader anywhere in particular.

 * the Paper's own `borderColor`, so the panel's resting outline is never something this has to
