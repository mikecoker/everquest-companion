// The `character` module carries the STATED level fact: the later of your last ding and your own
// `/who` row, with which one said it and when (shared/currentLevel.ts). This is the two lines that
// turn it into something a surface can draw — the subscription, and the read against the log clock
// the progression snapshot supplies.
//
// WHY THE FIELDS ARE FLATTENED AND NEVER NULL. Every consumer wants "the number, the cue beside it,
// the sentence on hover", and a nullable read makes each of them write the same three null guards.
// A level nothing has stated is `level: null` with two empty strings, which is exactly what the
// surfaces already do with it: omit the chip, print no cue, hang no tooltip.
