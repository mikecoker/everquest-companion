// WindowDropsPanel — WHAT DROPPED IN THE STRETCH YOU ARE LOOKING AT (JOS-78).
//
// The Leveling tab already answers "how fast am I levelling here" for whatever scope is in force
// (JOS-75). This is the same question about LOOT: the items observed dropping inside that scope,
// most-observed first, each with its in-window count and its rate over the scope's own active
// time. It is the panel two users asked for from opposite directions — "which zone pays more
// motes an hour" — and it reads the SAME window every other number on this tab reads, so a change
// of timescale moves it with everything else.
//
// NO INVENTED RANKING. The order is the observation: drops descending, then most recent, then
// name (`shared/lootRates.ts windowItemRows`). Motes float to the top because you loot a lot of
// them, not because anything here knows what a mote is worth — nothing in this repo ranks the ten
// tiers, and a per-tier weighting would be a fact the game never stated.
//
// ONE DENOMINATOR, STATED ONCE. Every row's rate divides by `stats.activeMs`, the scope's own
// active time, so the whole panel is measured over one span and says so in a single caption
// (`activeSpanText` — the leveling tab's existing spelling, not a second one). A rate that never
// stated its span would let one drop in five minutes read as a confident 12/hr.
//
// CLICKING A ROW OPENS THE ITEM DRILL-DOWN through the app's `openLoot` opener, which parks this
// tab on the navigation stack — so the drill's Back says "Back to Leveling" and returns here
// (JOS-43: one mechanism, never a per-view `cameFrom` prop).
