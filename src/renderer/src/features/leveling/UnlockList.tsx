// UnlockList — the rows of the "New at this level" panel (docs/plans/levelup-whats-new.md §2).
//
// ONE ROW SHAPE FOR BOTH LISTS. A spell and a discipline answer the same question ("what did this
// level give me") and differ only in what hangs off the name: a spell wears the class chips and a
// hover card built from the DB's own fields; a skill/disc/innate wears a KIND chip and, when the
// wiki contradicts itself about it, an honesty chip quoting the contradiction verbatim.
//
// THE HONESTY CHIP IS NOT DECORATION (law 1). Thirteen discipline rows — BER 2, MNK 10, RNG 1 —
// are stated with levels by their own class page and struck through by the central Disciplines
// page, which says only Rogue poison disciplines are on Legends. Both are the wiki's words. The
// row is drawn AND labeled, never silently shown and never silently dropped; the label's tooltip
// is the disputing sentence itself, copied out of classes.json.
//
// NEITHER FIXED-HEIGHT NOR WINDOWED ANY MORE (JOS-289 — this is the surface the owner NAMED as
// cramped). It was a 120px box with its own `overflow: auto` and `useWindowedRows` behind it: four
// and a half rows of a list that routinely has a dozen, read through a slot, in front of a panel
// whose whole job is "what did this level give me". Both halves are gone, and the second half is
// MEASURED rather than asserted: over all 560 three-class loadouts × 65 levels the longest list
// this join can produce is 41 rows (skills, BRD/MNK/SHD at 1; spells peak at 39, CLR/DRU/WIZ at
// 29), with p95 = 12 spells / 3 skills. That is not the row count `useWindowedRows` exists for —
// the loot ledger's thousands are — so the hook came off rather than being pointed at a container
// with no height to window against. `ROW_H` stays: uniform rows are what make the list scannable.
//
// THE SPELL NAME CARRIES THE FULL CARD (JOS-293, integrated here by JOS-289). This file used to
// draw its own five-field hover out of the four `UnlockSpell` fields the unlock join happens to
// carry. `SpellTooltip` (lib/SpellCard) asks MAIN for the whole record on open — the effect list
// in the wiki's own words, the derived rosters, the rank, the sentences the game prints — so the
// readout answers "should I memorize this" instead of restating the row.
//
// AND THE ROW NOW ANSWERS THE QUESTION WITHOUT THE HOVER (JOS-391). A list of names and class
// chips told a player WHAT unlocked and nothing about whether it was worth the trip to the vendor.
// Four statements were added, and each of them is a fact this app already holds:
//
//   the figures     `dmg 143 · dps 48 · 2.1 dmg/mana`, read off the wiki's own effect lines
//                   (shared/spellMetrics.ts) at the level the spell becomes yours
//   already yours   a class in YOUR loadout bought this six levels ago (shared/levelUnlocks.ts)
//   replaces        the rung below it in that class's upgrade line (the shipped research)
//   memorized       whether the spell it replaces is in your bar right now, and which of your
//                   saved sets would put it back (the spellSets module)
//
// A ROW GROWS A SECOND LINE ONLY WHEN IT HAS SOMETHING TO SAY. `ROW_H` still governs the name
// line, so a list of bare skill rows keeps exactly the rhythm JOS-289 kept it for; a spell with
// figures gets a quiet second line beneath its name rather than a wider first one, because the
// left column is narrow at the app's minimum width and the name is what a reader scans.
//
// NO CAVEATS PER ROW (AGENTS.md, the tooltip and caveat diet). The word `directional` is said ONCE
// in the panel header and nowhere else; no row footnotes where its number came from.
//
// AND THE ERA VERDICT IS DRAWN THE WAY THE MOB PAGE DRAWS IT (JOS-393). eqlwiki badges a link to
// `Sloths Healing` — `{{Kunark Era}}`, `Shaman - Level 50+` — out of era, and this list offered it
// to a level-50 shaman as a spell newly his. Two treatments, one rule:
//   A LEVEL LIST folds them behind a `+N out of era` disclosure — `outOfEraLabel`, the mob page's
//   own phrase, IMPORTED rather than re-typed so the two surfaces cannot drift — because a level
//   list answers "what is new for me now" and an unopened expansion is not part of that answer.
//   A SEARCH RESULT is shown plainly with an `out of era` chip, because a search answers the
//   question the player typed and hiding the row would answer a different one.
// A spell the era sidecar has no verdict for wears nothing and is folded nowhere: silence is not a
// verdict (law 1), and the drops list made the same call for the same reason.
//
// AND THE ROW NOW SAYS WHICH RUNG YOU ARE ON (JOS-446). Every name in this list is the catalog's,
// which means it is the BASE name: the list offers `Clarity` while the scroll in your bags reads
// `Clarity III`, because the wiki scrape carries one unsuffixed row for ~1,800 of its ~1,900
// spells. `yours: III` is the observed-rank module's answer, drawn only where there is one — an
// unobserved line wears nothing, and a rank-1 observation is not drawn at all (rank 1 is every
// spell's default, so the chip would restate it). The FIGURES beside it are still the line's, and
// for a ranked spell they understate; src/main/modules/observedSpellRanks.ts carries that
// statement in full, and it stays off the screen (the caveat diet).
