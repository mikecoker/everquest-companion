// windowScope.ts — WHICH STRETCH OF THE LOG the Leveling tab's numbers describe (JOS-75).
//
// JOS-71 gave the two plots a timescale; it moved the CURVES and nothing else, so a user who
// picked `1h` got an hour-wide chart sitting above a rate measured over the whole log. This
// module is the seam that fixes that: one scope, computed once, read by every number on the tab.
//
// Pure. No React, no DOM, no MUI. The one VALUE import is relative
// (`../../../../shared/progressionStats`) rather than `@shared/*`, because the node test runner
// has no such alias — the overviewLevelingData.ts precedent, and the reason
// tests/levelingWindowScope.test.mts can import this file straight under tsx.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE THREE RULES
//
//   1. ONE DERIVATION, NEVER A SECOND RATE MATH. The scope's numbers are `rangeStats` — the
//      same pure query the drag-select panel has always used, over a different pair of
//      instants. Nothing here divides anything by anything; a second implementation of
//      "levels per active hour" is exactly the drift this seam exists to prevent.
//
//   2. THE SCOPE IS THE WINDOW ∩ THE RECORD. The DRAWN window is not the stats window: every
//      scale carries a trailing pad (chartWindow.ts `TRAILING_FRAC`) and a fixed one snaps both
//      ends OUTWARD to the bucket grid, so the drawn `t1` sits past the newest event on purpose
//      — that gutter is what makes the current level read as a plateau instead of a bare
//      endpoint. Counting it as time would hand every window a slab of manufactured silence at
//      its right edge. So the scope clamps to `dataBounds`, and the consequence is the identity
//      this module is pinned on: at `All` the scope is EXACTLY `[lo, hi]`, which is the range a
//      full-history read has always meant.
//
//   3. A SELECTION IS A NARROWER RANGE ON THE SAME BASE, AND IT WINS. A committed drag is the
//      user saying something more specific than the timescale did, so while one exists every
//      number follows IT — and `useChartSelection` already drops a selection the new window
//      cannot contain, so the two can never describe disjoint stretches. Clearing it falls back
//      to the window with no other state involved: the scope is a function of (snapshot,
//      window, bounds, selection), never a thing anybody stores.
