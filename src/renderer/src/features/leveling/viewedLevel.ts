// THE LEVEL THE LEVELING TAB IS SHOWING — one number, two panels (JOS-445).
//
// It lived inside `NewAtLevelPanel` while that panel was the only thing that had a level to show.
// The best-spells readout is the second, it sits in the OTHER column, and the owner's ask is that
// stepping the level re-ranks it — so the state has to be above both of them. The alternative was a
// second stepper, which is two levels on one screen with no way to tell which one a table is about.
//
// `null` MEANS "FOLLOW THE CHARACTER", not "level 1". That distinction is what keeps the tab
// tracking dings until the reader steps it, and what makes the `back to N` chip a return to the
// character rather than a jump to a remembered number.
//
// The band is the DB's (1..63) with a ceiling that leaves room to grow, and clamping is done in one
// place so a deep link, a keypress and a stepper click cannot disagree about what level 0 means.
