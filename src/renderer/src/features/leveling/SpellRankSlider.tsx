// leveling/SpellRankSlider.tsx — THE MOTE-RANK SIMULATOR for the best-spells readout (JOS-447).
//
// WHAT IT IS. The gear tab's `UpgradeSlider` metaphor, in a column a fifth of its width: one stop
// per mote rank, and every row of the table below reads at `max(its own observed rank, this)`. The
// owner's ask was a comparison, not a forecast - "compare upgraded damage to the max i have of a
// different spell. then it would be nice to simulate upgrade of a separate spell" - so the control
// lifts the WHOLE table and never pulls a spell the log has watched you cast back down.
//
// STACKED, NOT A ROW, AND THAT IS THE 260px FLOOR TALKING. `UpgradeSlider` puts its caption, slider
// and label on one line because the gear tab is the whole window wide. This panel is a third of the
// row at `lg` with a 260px floor at the app's own minimum width, and `BestSpellsPanel`'s own header
// records that four numeric columns already ask for 272px of it. So the caption and the label share
// one line and the slider takes the next one whole - the same two controls, in the space there is.
//
// SESSION STATE, NOT PERSISTED, and the caller owns it. The gear slider's persistence ruling was
// about a FORM that lost everything on a tab switch; this is one integer with an obvious base, and
// a glance away and back should show the readout's real answer rather than the last question
// somebody asked it - the same rule the tab selection above it already follows.
//
// AND IT SAYS WHAT IT IS SIMULATING, PERMANENTLY (the gear-upgrade-label law). The label is drawn
// at every position, including base, and it names the two limits that matter: the rank the table is
// being lifted to, and the fact that only DAMAGE moves with it (shared/spellScale.ts fitted the
// damage rate to the owner's log and scopes v1 there; mana, cast time and healing stay at base).
