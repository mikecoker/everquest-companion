// aaPaceRows.ts — the PURE shaping behind AaPacePanel: an `AaPace` (the answer
// `shared/aaPace.ts` computed) turned into the exact strings the panel prints. No React, no
// MUI, and only TYPE imports from `@shared`, so tests/aaPace.test.mts drives it under tsx —
// the same constraint rangeStatsRows.ts / zoneBands.ts document.
//
// THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE: which numbers are MEASURED and which are MODELLED is
// visible on the panel, not buried in a doc. Two of the four tiles are counts the game printed;
// two are a model over them. So every shaped value carries an `inferred` flag — and the CHIP the
// panel draws from it is the whole disclosure (AGENTS.md tooltip diet: one word beats a
// paragraph). The hover sentences here name what a tile measures, never how it might be wrong.
