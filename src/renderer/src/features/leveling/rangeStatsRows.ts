// rangeStatsRows.ts — the PURE shaping behind RangeStatsPanel: a `RangeStats` (the answer
// `shared/progressionStats.rangeStats` computed) turned into the exact strings the panel
// prints. No React, no DOM, no MUI, and only TYPE imports from `@shared`, so
// tests/rangeStatsRows.test.mts can import it straight under tsx (there is no `@shared/*`
// alias in the node test runner — the same constraint zoneBands.ts / levelChartGeometry.ts
// document).
//
// WHY IT IS A SEPARATE FILE. Every honesty rule this feature has is a FORMATTING decision:
// whether a rate prints or an em-dash prints, whether a number is called "levels" or "xp",
// whether a zone row admits the log stated no percentage. Those are the things that rot
// silently inside JSX. Here they are functions with return values, and the test file pins
// them.
//
// THE THREE RULES THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE (plan §4, §6.4):
//   1. A NULL rate renders as an em-dash — NEVER '0.0'. `levelsPerHourActive` is null when
//      the window has no active time, and also when every experience line in it stated no
//      percentage. Printing 0.0 there would be a fabricated measurement of a quantity the
//      log declined to report.
//   2. `levelEquiv` is LEVELS OF PROGRESS, never "xp". The log prints a percentage of the
//      CURRENT level's bar and nothing else — no raw total, no to-next-level requirement,
//      no bar position — and 1% at level 40 is far more raw experience than 1% at level 10.
//      No surface in this file may say xp, exp points, or experience points.
//   3. A row with unstated samples SAYS SO. `expUnstated > 0` is a real state of the world
//      (the game prints a percentage only while a level bar exists), not a rounding artifact.
//   4. "OFFLINE" IS SAID ONLY WHERE THE LOG SAID IT. Every offline string here is null unless
//      `offlineMs > 0` — i.e. unless a camp/login line actually derived a logout. Silence with
//      no login line yet is still "idle" with its existing caption, because the user may be
//      logged out RIGHT NOW and the log cannot say so until they come back. That is why the
//      idle caption below is untouched by this feature: it must not learn a word it cannot
//      justify, and with no offline interval in range every string in this file is byte
//      identical to what it was before offline existed.
