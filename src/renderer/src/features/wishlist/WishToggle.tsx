// wishlist/WishToggle.tsx — ONE CONTROL, BOTH SURFACES: add this thing to the wish list, click it
// again to take it off (JOS-343, owner ruling 2026-08-13).
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. Until this ticket there were two controls that meant the same thing
// and agreed about none of it. The Exaltations donor row had a TEXT button reading "Add to wish
// list" that went DISABLED and read "Wished" once the item was on (JOS-326); the gear search row —
// added one day earlier — had a HEART that lit up and, lit, did nothing (JOS-335). The owner ruled
// the same day the heart shipped: the gear row gets the donor row's control, and BOTH of them
// toggle. Two components that must stay word-for-word identical is a rule nobody can enforce, so
// there is one component and the two surfaces differ by a prop.
//
// THE OVERRULED ARGUMENTS, NAMED, because both were written down as reasoning and both are now
// wrong — a revision that leaves its predecessor's case standing is how a file starts lying:
//
//   * "THE GEAR ROW MUST BE AN ICON" (JOS-335, GearTable.tsx `WishButton`). The case was width: a
//     `tableLayout: fixed` name column against a ~130px text button on 6,766 rows. OVERRULED for
//     parity — the two surfaces are one feature and must read as one.
//   * "…AND THE GEAR ROW GETS SHORTER WORDS" (JOS-343, the `compact` prop this file used to carry:
//     Wish / Remove for the dense table, measured against the Item column in the e2e). OVERRULED
//     IN TURN by the owner on 2026-08-13 (JOS-346): same words both places, and the width cost is
//     ACCEPTED rather than measured around. Half-parity was the worst of the two — a reader who
//     learns the control on one tab meets a different pair of words on the other and has to work
//     out that they are the same thing. The measurement that pinned the short wording went with
//     it: an assertion that a control fits under a third of its column is an assertion that the
//     SHORT wording is in force, so keeping it would have failed on the ruling rather than
//     testing it.
//   * "LIT IS A NO-OP" / "WISHED IS DISABLED". Both surfaces used to answer a second click with
//     nothing — the donor row by refusing it, the gear row by swallowing it. OVERRULED: a second
//     click REMOVES the wish, through `useWishlist.remove`, which is the same `removeWish` fold the
//     Wish list tab's own per-row remove calls. There is exactly one deletion shape in the app.
//
// THE TITLE STATES THE ACTION FOR THE STATE THE CONTROL IS IN, never the state itself. "Add to the
// wish list" when it is off, "Remove from the wish list" when it is on — a caption on a toggle is
// read as a prediction of the click, and one that reported status instead ("Already on your wish
// list") is what made the old heart's second click feel broken.
//
// NATIVE `title`, NEVER A POPPER (JOS-143). Both hosts are dense scrolling rows under a toolbar of
// dropdowns, and GearTable.tsx's header holds the full argument plus the one narrow exception the
// owner granted it (the hover compare card, which is not interactive and never opens upward).
