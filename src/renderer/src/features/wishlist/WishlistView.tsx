// wishlist/WishlistView.tsx — THE FLAT WISH LIST (JOS-326; the shell it replaces was JOS-324's
// honest placeholder).
//
// WHAT THIS TAB IS. One list of things this character has decided they want, written by hand,
// grouped by where to go and get them. It is FLAT by owner ruling: a wish names an item and
// nothing else — no equipment cell, no socket, no host — and targeting a host item for an
// exaltation is an explicitly later addition. The plan board this ticket removed is what a wish
// list would have turned back into if that ruling were softened.
//
// FOUR CONTROLS AND A ROLLUP:
//   * ADD — one button over the WHOLE corpus, gear rows and donor rows in one result list, each
//     labelled with its kind (WishAdd + wishSearch.ts).
//   * SEARCH — a box over the WISHES themselves. A list you write yourself gets long, and the
//     rollup groups by zone, so "where is that helm on here" is a real question the groups cannot
//     answer.
//   * ERA — the shared `eq.planner.era` toggle, hiding out-of-era wishes from the ROUTE and saying
//     how many. It deliberately does not reach the add control (wishSearch.ts argues why).
//   * REMOVE — per row, and it is the only destructive control on the tab.
//
// THE ROLLUP IS THE OLD FARM DERIVATION, RE-AIMED. `wishFarm.collectWishNeeds` resolves each wish
// against both corpus indices and the progress join; `plannerFarm.groupNeeds` does the zone
// arithmetic unchanged, non-zone headings and all. Nothing about that fold was ever specific to
// exaltation sets.
//
// AND EVERY NAME IS A LINK. `onOpenLoot` is the app's standing idiom (appRouting): a click takes
// the Loot tab over with that item's drill-down, which since JOS-127/JOS-143 states what the
// committed DBs know about where it drops beside what this character has observed. Same contract
// the Exaltations tab's donor names use, so the drill's Back arrow comes home to the right tab.
//
// THE LIST IS ITS OWN SCROLLER (AGENTS.md UI conventions): a wish list grows, and a growing list
// lives in a bounded box rather than growing the page.
