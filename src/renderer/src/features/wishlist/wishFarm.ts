// wishlist/wishFarm.ts — THE WISH LIST, TURNED INTO A ROUTE (JOS-326).
//
// The Farm tab is gone and the arithmetic behind it is not. `features/planner/plannerFarm.ts` was
// always a pure fold over needs — the primary zone (the one that feeds the most of the rest), the
// "also:" tail with each zone's expansion, the four honest non-zone headings, and the JOS-42 rule
// that a heading with the era filter on must be somewhere you can actually GO. None of that was
// ever about exaltation sets; it was about a list of items you want and where they drop. So this
// file is the collection half, re-aimed: wishes in, `FarmNeed`s out, `groupNeeds` unchanged.
//
// TWO INDICES ANSWER, AND EITHER MAY BE SILENT. A donor wish resolves against the DONOR CORPUS by
// (key, effect) — that row carries the merge tier, the effect's own facts and the item page's drop
// list. A gear wish resolves against the GEAR INDEX by key. A wish neither index knows (a rescrape
// dropped the page, or the store came from another machine) still produces a row: the name it was
// saved with, the mob catalog's own answer for its key, and nothing claimed that nobody stated.
//
// THE MERGE COST IS DONOR-ONLY, AND THAT IS NOT A GAP. "needs +4 - ≈15 D0 merges" answers "how far
// up the upgrade ladder before this effect can be EXTRACTED", which is a question a gear wish never
// asked: you want the breastplate, and looting it is the whole job. So `tierRequired` is absent
// there and the row says nothing about merging.
//
// FULFILLED MEANS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS, FOR THE SAME REASON. A donor wish is done when the log has
// seen the item merged to its extraction tier — `ready`, the state chip's own word, because short
// of that tier the effect will not come out. A gear wish is done the moment you HAVE one: held in
// the last dump or ever looted. Asking the merge ladder about a gear wish would leave a helm you
// are wearing sitting in the route forever.
//
// PURE AND NODE-TESTABLE (`tests/wishFarm.test.mts`) — every value import is relative, and the
// progress join arrives as a function rather than as a hook.

 *
 * GEAR: held or looted. The log's merge ladder is not consulted at all, so an item you own reads
 * done whether or not you have ever merged it, and a `+0` observation cannot un-own it.
 *
 * `looted` counts an item you looted and later sold, gave away or destroyed, and that is the
 * intended reading rather than a bug: this decides whether the ROUTE still has to send you
 * somewhere, and a camp you have already beaten is not somewhere you need to be told to go. The
