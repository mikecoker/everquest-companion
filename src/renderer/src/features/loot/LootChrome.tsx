// Split out of LootView (JOS-160) when the view crossed its measured line ceiling. Nothing here
// changed in the move except where it lives; the one NEW member is `OwnedNotLootedNotice`, and its
// header says why it exists. The split is along the seam the file already had: LootView owns the
// state and the derivation, this file owns the chrome, and the table is `LootTables.tsx`.
//
// NO TOOLTIP MOUNTS ANYWHERE IN HERE (JOS-127, owner direction 2026-08-09). A 0.14.0 user could not
// change the sort because interactive hover cards on the surfaces below the toolbar opened upward
// across it and ate the click. The rule travelled with the code: labels and accessible names say
// what a popper used to, and `tests/tooltipCursor.test.mts` pins the absence structurally.
