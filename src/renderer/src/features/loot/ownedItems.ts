// ============================================================================
//
// THE DEFECT THIS MODULE EXISTS FOR. A 0.15.0 player held three `Ivory Sky Diamond` — `/finditem`
// said so, his `/outputfile inventory` said so, and the Plane of Sky tab agreed, showing the
// Paladin Test of Spirit ready to hand in. The Loot page could not find the item at all: the
// search returned nothing and the item page reported it had never been looted. Two surfaces of one
// app, one reconcile, opposite answers.
//
// The cause was not a name (there is exactly one spelling of that item in the whole tree, and no
// `+N` variant), not a parser gap (the item was acquired before this log exists, so no loot line
// will ever appear), and not the keyring (JOS-66's rule already counts it — that is WHY the Sky tab
// was right). The cause is that the Loot page's search corpus is the LOOT LEDGER while the Sky
// tab's is what you HOLD, and everything the export knows lived in a second list the search only
// reached after the user found and clicked a chip — under the default `log` count source, a list
// that had already been emptied (see reconcile.ts's `buildRows`).
//
// So the two rules below are the reconciliation, and they are kept in their own file because
// `lootGrouping.ts` cannot be loaded by node (it imports `lootItemData` → `data/index` →
// `@shared/profiles`, a value import that only the bundler resolves — the same reason `lootSort.ts`
// lives apart). A rule nobody can unit-test is a rule that drifts; `tests/lootOwnedItems.test.mts`
// drives these directly.

 * THE ORDER IS RECONCILE'S, UNTOUCHED (JOS-345). `source` arrives net-descending — most-held
