// useNotablePickups (Task #53) — surface the last few looted items that are lore- or

// the local Plane of Sky set to any wiki-known quest item.
//
// Loot knowledge lives in MAIN (local-posky-first + cached wiki lookup). We can't know
// synchronously whether an arbitrary looted item is notable, so this hook lazily fetches
// knowledge for the most-recent distinct looted items (bounded), memoizes each result in
// a renderer-side map, and returns (a) that map for row indicators and (b) the ordered
// notable subset for the strip. Bounded + memoized so it never storms main: each distinct
// name is fetched at most once; main's serialized queue + persistent cache throttle the
// rest. Fully additive — no change to how loot is transported.
