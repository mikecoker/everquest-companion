// useItemZoneRates — the item drill-down's per-zone drop rates (JOS-78).
//
// It joins TWO modules that already exist and adds no third store: the `loot` history supplies the
// drops (each row already carrying the zone it happened in — see lootRates.ts rule 1), and the
// `progression` snapshot supplies the DENOMINATOR, through the very same `rangeStats` query the
// Leveling tab's range panel reads. Nothing here divides anything by anything; `lootRates.ts` does
// the arithmetic and this hook only decides WHICH RANGE.
//
// THE RANGE IS THE CALLER'S SLICE, AND THE WHOLE RECORD WHEN THERE IS NONE (JOS-130). This
// drill-down still invents no scope of its own — it now FOLLOWS the app's one timeslice control
// when the surface it was opened from has one (the Loot ledger, which already cut the `events` it
// hands in), and falls back to `dataBounds` end to end for the Mobs tab's dialog, which opens over
// a page that carries no control. Either way the same `+1 ms` tail `windowScope.statsRangeFor`
// uses keeps the newest event inside a half-open range.
//
// THE DENOMINATOR AND THE NUMERATOR COME FROM ONE SLICE OR NEITHER. `events` is cut by the caller
// and the zone rows are queried here; handing in a sliced numerator and asking for a whole-record
// denominator would read as a farm that fell off a cliff.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: it never consults the wiki's `dropsFrom`. Those rows are elsewhere on this
// page, chipped `db`, answering the same question from the committed catalog — and blending them
// into a rate would put a number this character never observed under an `observed` heading.
