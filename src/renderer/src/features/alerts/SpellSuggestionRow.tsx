// SpellSuggestionRow — one spell LINE in the suggested-alerts wizard, and the chips it wears.
//
// Split out of SuggestAlertsDialog.tsx when the levelling intelligence (level chip, most-
// recently-cast rank, rank-pinned template chips) pushed that file past the 400-code-line
// factoring ceiling.
//
// COMPACT (docs/plans/suggest-dialog-redesign.md §3, owner: "more compact so things fit on
// screen"). The row is ONE LINE whenever one line will hold it: the NAME is the single
// shrinkable/ellipsizing thing, and the chips never shrink. `flexWrap` turns overflow into HEIGHT
// (AGENTS.md), which is what made the old pre-redesign row two and three lines tall on a spell
// with several classes, so height is spent only where it is the alternative to a collision —
// see SUGGEST_ROW_SX for what JOS-190 measured and why the row now wraps as its last resort.
//
// WHAT THE ROW STATES (never process — AGENTS.md UI conventions):
//   * the spell's line name,
//   * its class levels as one chip per class ("ENC 16"), RESOLVED classes first, with the
//     overflow folded into a "+N" chip whose tooltip names the rest. The spell DB has no
//     per-RANK levels at all, so a rank-III row still shows the LINE's level and says so,
//   * the rank you MOST RECENTLY CAST, when the log has shown one,
//   * how often the buffs model has observed the line.
// Buff/debuff is NOT a chip any more: the section header the row sits under states it, except
// in "From your fights", which mixes both — that section passes `showType`.

 * IT WRAPS (JOS-190, GitHub issue 22). It used to be `nowrap` on the compact-bar contract
 * (AGENTS.md: "`flexWrap` converts content overflow into HEIGHT"), and that contract is still
 * right about height — but it comes with a second half the row was not honouring: the shrinkable
 * group must actually CLIP. A row wears up to seven chips whose labels are whole sentences
 * ("When it wears off (you or your pet)", "When it lands on someone (say who)", plus a rank-pinned
 * pair when the log has seen you cast one), and past ~836px of dialog those simply do not fit on
 * one line at any font. The old row answered that by squeezing the facts group and letting it
 * overprint the chips; wrapping answers it by giving the chips their own line when — and ONLY
 * when — they cannot share one. A row that fitted before still fits on one line and is
 * byte-identical: flex wrapping is decided on the items' natural widths, so nothing that used to
 * fit moves.
