// resultSections — the suggest dialog's row set, as a pure function.
//
// docs/plans/suggest-dialog-redesign.md §2: one filtered catalog becomes FIVE row groups, in
// this order — "From your fights" (everything the log has actually seen, in the catalog's own
// recency order), then Buffs · Debuffs · Illusions · Poisons for the rest. A row appears in
// exactly ONE group: an observed spell is listed where the observation is the point, and the
// type sections carry the tail the log has never shown you.
//
// THE ROW BUDGET IS THE PERF FIX'S INVARIANT, and it survives the sectioning. The dialog mounts
// at most MAX_ROWS memoized `SpellRow`s in total (never per section), because the whole reason
// the paper holds still is that the row count is bounded and the list scrolls inside a fixed
// height. Sections are filled IN ORDER until the budget runs out; each one reports its TRUE
// match count so a truncated section can say how many it is not showing rather than lie by
// omission. Collapsed sections mount nothing at all and hand their budget on.
//
// Pure + RELATIVE value imports (the mobSearch.ts precedent) so tests/spellSearch.test.mts can
// drive it over the REAL catalog with no vite alias.

 *
 * A query carrying ANY spell-only token (`level:`, `class:`, `type:`, a bare number) hides the
 * section outright: those facets are statements about spells, and a set that matched them by
 * accident would be a wrong answer, not a bonus one.
 *
 * A BARE CLASS WORD IS NOT SPELL-ONLY (JOS-392). It became a class TOKEN when the grammar learned
 * to read `cleric` as a class, but it keeps a text half by design (shared/spellSearch.ts's header
 * says why), and this section reads exactly that half. MEASURED, and the reason this is not a
 * detail: the shipped `You died` set quotes a line carrying the word `magician`, so treating the
 * whole token as spell-only would have made a set unreachable by a word printed on it. The
 * DECLARED spelling `class:mag` still stands the section down — a prefix is a statement about
 * spells whatever it names.
