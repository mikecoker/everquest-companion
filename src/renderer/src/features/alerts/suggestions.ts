/**
 * Build the AlertDef for one (rank, rank-template) pair. The trigger pins the DISPLAY name
 * with its suffix, which is exactly what makes the def go stale on a level-up — and exactly
 * what `detectRankUpgrades` (shared/spellLines.ts) looks for.
 *
 * THE RESIST CHIP SAYS WHICH SPELL (JOS-347). Every resist suggestion draws the same pack sound,
 * which is right for a player who owns one of them and useless for the player who reported this:
 * a bard clicked the chip on all four Tuyen chants and got four alerts that were, to the ear, one
 * alert. And a bard is exactly the case that produces them at once — measured against the owner's
 * own log, a bard's songs all re-apply in the SAME six-second pulse, so the four resist lines
 * arrive together. Four identical sounds in one instant is one sound (audioThrottle.ts, and it is
 * right to fold them); four DIFFERENT lines are four facts, and the throttle now keeps them all.
 * So the def the wizard authors names its own spell out loud, in the same shape and for the same
 * reasons as `landsOnOther`: `audio:'speech'`, because the whole value of this suggestion is the
 * word that tells the four chants apart. (It shipped on the combined 'both' channel until JOS-362
 * retired that channel.) The phrase is editable like any other — this is the DEFAULT that the
 * reporter had to build by hand four times.
 *
 * `castRank` is deliberately left alone: its lines are one per cast, not one per song pulse, and
 * a chip that starts talking because its twin had to is a change nobody asked for.
