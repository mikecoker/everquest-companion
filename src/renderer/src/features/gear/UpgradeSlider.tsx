// gear/UpgradeSlider.tsx — THE GLOBAL PLUS-STATE SELECTOR: every number in the table, at +N.
//
// WHAT IT IS. `ItemUpgradeState` is the in-game item window's `Tier N   x / y` row (phase 0,
// src/shared/itemUpgrade.ts): `full` is the tier 0..10 and `fraction` is the merge exp banked
// toward the next one, out of `2^full`. So the control is TWO sliders and not one — a single
// slider over the 1,024 reachable states would put nine of its eleven tiers in the last third of
// its travel, because the states are not evenly distributed. The tier slider is the one anybody
// drags; the fraction slider appears only where a fraction exists (tier 0 has no denominator and
// tier 10 is the cap, so neither can bank partial exp — `normalizeUpgradeState` states that rule
// and this control obeys it rather than restating it).
//
// WHY A LIVE SLIDER IS ALLOWED HERE. Scaling all 6,766 rows at one state is measured at ~18 ms
// (tests/gearIndex.test.mts prints it on every run), which is inside a frame — that measurement is
// the whole reason the ticket could ask for a live selector instead of an Apply button. The table
// still reads the state through `useDeferredValue` (GearView), so the THUMB is never waiting on a
// re-sort of six thousand rows: the control echoes instantly and the numbers follow, which is the
// same law the search box has obeyed since the beginning.
//
// AND IT SAYS WHAT IT IS SIMULATING. The percent label is `percentLabel` — phase 0's own spelling
// of the number the wiki's item slider displays (`+27.5%`) — beside the raw `Tier 2 · 3/4`, so the
// row can be read against the item window in the game without translating anything.
