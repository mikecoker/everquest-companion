// gear/gearColumns.ts — WHICH numeric columns the table draws, and how wide they are.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. `GEAR_STAT_KEYS` is 32 keys wide and the ticket asks to sort by ANY of
// them, regens and backstab included. Thirty-two columns is not a table anyone can read, so the
// column list is DERIVED: a small always-on core, plus a column for whatever the table is sorted
// by. Sort by `BACKSTAB` and the backstab column appears; sort by something else and it goes.
//
// THE DERIVATION USED TO HAVE A SECOND SOURCE — every stat a THRESHOLD was filtering on — and
// JOS-302 removed it with the thresholds themselves (owner ruling 2026-08-13: sorting services that
// need without spending toolbar real estate). What is left is the honest remainder of the same
// sentence: a stat you are RANKING by is a stat you are looking at, so it gets a column. That is a
// derivation of at most ONE column now, which is why there is no cap on it any more — the old
// `MAX_DERIVED_COLUMNS` capped a list that could grow with every chip typed, and a list that can
// never exceed core+1 caps itself.
//
// AND SINCE JOS-297 THE DERIVATION IS THE SEED, NOT THE ANSWER (owner feedback on the shipped
// tab: *ALL stats should be there*). The derivation was a bet that asking about a stat is the only
// way anyone says they want to see it, and the bet was wrong: a player comparing two breastplates
// wants the seven attributes on screen without inventing seven thresholds to conjure them. So the
// picker offers the WHOLE vocabulary (`PICKABLE_COLUMNS` — every `GearStatKey`, plus the DERIVED
// `RATIO` and, since JOS-336, `EFF_HP`) and
// an explicit choice WINS; absent a choice the derivation still runs, which is what keeps the tab's
// first screen what it was. The distinction the storage layer has to preserve is therefore ABSENT
// vs EMPTY: no stored key means "derive", a stored `[]` means "the user asked for no numeric
// columns at all", and the two must never fold together. THE PICKER IS ALSO WHERE A THRESHOLD'S
// OTHER JOB WENT: you name the column you want and then you sort it.
//
// EVERY DRAWN NUMERIC COLUMN IS SORTABLE, and that has always been true of the machinery
// (`sortGearRows` takes any `GearSortKey`) — the gap the owner hit was EXPOSURE: a key with no
// column had no header to click. The picker closes it by construction, so there is no second list
// of "sortable keys" here to drift from the drawn ones.
//
// WIDTHS: PERCENTAGES WHILE THEY FIT, PIXELS WHEN THEY DO NOT — and both halves are JOS-260's law
// rather than a preference. The table is `tableLayout: fixed` (a windowed table whose columns
// re-measure per slice moves its row heights under a hook whose every index assumes they cannot —
// LootTables.tsx states the full argument). Under percentages the numeric columns SHARE a fixed
// budget: N columns each take `NUMERIC_BUDGET / N`, the identity columns take a constant, and the
// NAME column states no width at all so it absorbs the slack. Each share is CLAMPED both ways —
// a CEILING (`MAX_NUMERIC_WIDTH`) because a stat cell holds at most `-12345` and handing four
// columns 13% apiece starves the one column that actually ellipsises, the item name; and a FLOOR
// (`MIN_NUMERIC_WIDTH`), which is what used to cap the derived count — past ten numeric
// columns a percentage can only be bought by making every column illegible, because percentages
// cannot make a fixed table wider than its box. So past ten the layout switches to STATED PIXELS
// plus a `minWidth` on the table: the table becomes wider than the pane and the pane, which is
// already `overflow: auto`, scrolls it SIDEWAYS INSIDE ITSELF. The page never scrolls sideways —
// that is the whole point of the switch, and `tests/e2e/gearColumnSteps.mts` measures both.
//
// PURE AND NODE-TESTABLE (relative value imports, the house law): this file decides the shape of
// the table, so `tests/gearFilter.test.mts` can assert that a sort key brings its column with it
// and `tests/gearColumnPrefs.test.mts` that a chosen set of thirty overflows on purpose.
