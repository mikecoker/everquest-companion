// gear/useGearPrefs.ts — the two view preferences the Gear tab remembers (JOS-297).
//
// THE STORAGE TIER IS `localStorage`, and the argument is `usePlans.ts`'s two tiers: which columns
// you like to read and which controls you keep on screen are facts about THIS MACHINE's window,
// with no meaning on another one and nothing to validate in main. So they sit under the
// `eq.<feature>.*` idiom and never cross IPC. (The argument arrived here from `useGearSets.ts`,
// which kept `eq.gear.set` / `eq.gear.setsOpen` on the same tier until JOS-325 retired the sets.)
//
// AND THEY ARE PREFERENCES PRECISELY BECAUSE A VIEW UNMOUNTS ON EVERY TAB SWITCH (JOS-90/97/116,
// the same bug three times). A column set held in `useState` would survive exactly until the user
// looked at the Loot tab. The two traps that law names are both avoided here: nothing resets from
// an effect (every write is on the change handler), and every read goes through `gearPrefs.ts`'s
// sanitizers, so a stored value from another build DEGRADES to the derived default instead of
// throwing inside a render.
//
// `null` IS A VALUE HERE, NOT A FAILURE — it is "no choice stored", which is what makes the
// derived column seed and the full toolbar the answer. Clearing a choice therefore REMOVES the
// key rather than writing `[]`, because `[]` is a different statement (gearPrefs.ts's header).
