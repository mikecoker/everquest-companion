// gear/GearTable.tsx — the windowed table: one uniform row per candidate item.
//
// THE FIXED-HEIGHT CONTRACT (JOS-260, lootRows.tsx states the full argument). `useWindowedRows` is
// a FIXED-row-height hook: every spacer, index and scroll offset it computes assumes each row is
// exactly `ROW_HEIGHT`, so a row that wraps to two lines desyncs the whole window and the drift
// compounds with every row above the viewport. `height` alone is only a MINIMUM for a table row,
// so the row states a maximum too and every cell is one clipped, ellipsised line — and the table
// is `tableLayout: fixed` with PERCENTAGE widths, so the columns are taken from the header alone
// (a windowed table can only ever SEE a screenful, and an auto layout would re-measure its columns
// every time scrolling swapped the rows underneath).
//
// A ROW'S KEY IS `row.key` — `itemKey(name)`, the corpus join key every other index in this app
// uses (loot, ownership, donors). That is deliberate and load-bearing beyond React, and phase 4
// (JOS-285) is what it was for: the OWNED column appends after `visibleColumns`' numerics and its
// cell is one `Map.get(row.key)` — no name matching, no normalising, nothing per row but a lookup.
// The words in that cell are all decided in `gearOwnership.ts`, which is pure and node-tested; the
// only judgement made HERE is that no witness at all means no column, because a blank ownership
// cell and "you do not own this" are two different statements and the app cannot tell them apart.
//
// NO MUI TOOLTIP ANYWHERE (JOS-143). These are dense rows under a toolbar full of selects and a
// slider; an interactive popper opened from the first row lands on those controls and eats the
// clicks aimed at them. Every explanation is a native `title`.
//
// …AND SINCE JOS-338 THERE IS EXACTLY ONE POPPER, WHICH IS THE NARROWING JOS-181 ALREADY MADE
// ELSEWHERE. The sentence above was never about the popper existing — it was about an INTERACTIVE
// card belonging to a row BELOW the toolbar, opening UPWARD across it and holding the pointer while
// it was up. The owner ruled that trade the other way on the Sky tab (JOS-181) and has now asked for
// the card here: hovering a row shows what the item would REPLACE. So the rule narrows to what it
// was always about, and the guarantee is structural rather than a promise — the cards are mounted
// through ONE wrapper (`GearCompareCard.tsx`'s `GearRowCompare`) that always opens them BELOW the
// row and clamped inside the window, never above it, with no pointer events at all and a
// capture-phase pointerdown close (JOS-344 rewrote that geometry; read its header). Every
// OTHER explanation in this file is still a native `title`, including both of the wish control's
// (JOS-343 kept them native when it took the heart away): a caption is not a card, and nothing else
// here grows a popper.
//
// AND SINCE JOS-297 THE COLUMN SET CAN BE WIDER THAN THE PANE. Nothing above changes: the table is
// still `tableLayout: fixed`, the row is still exactly `ROW_HEIGHT` tall with one clipped line per
// cell, and the windowing hook's contract does not know that widths exist. What changes is where
// the widths come from — `gearTableLayout` states percentages while they fit and stated pixels plus
// a table `minWidth` once they do not, so a thirty-column set overflows the table's OWN scroller
// (GearView's `gear-list` box, already `overflow: auto`) and never the page. Both halves are
// measured in `tests/e2e/gearColumnSteps.mts`, container-scroll and page-no-scroll in one step.
//
// AND SINCE JOS-335 A SEARCH ROW HAS A GESTURE AGAIN: it goes on the wish list. The tombstone in
// the name cell below records that JOS-325 took the sets `+` away and left the table with no
// per-row action at all, while the Exaltations donor rows kept theirs (JOS-326 re-aimed that button
// at the wish list). This restores the parity: same door (`useWishlist`), same document, same
// dedupe. What it deliberately does NOT restore is a COLUMN — the control shares the item name's
// cell exactly as the `+` did, because `gearTableLayout` states the width of every other column and
// a new one would be a change to the layout contract for one small control.
//
// …AND SINCE JOS-343 THAT GESTURE IS THE DONOR ROW'S CONTROL, WORD FOR WORD, AND IT TOGGLES (owner
// ruling 2026-08-13, one day after the heart shipped). Two JOS-335 arguments were overruled and
// both used to be argued at length right here, so both are named rather than quietly deleted:
//
//   * THE HEART. JOS-335 chose an ICON over the donor row's text button and the case was WIDTH —
//     `tableLayout: fixed`, a name column with no stated width to spare, 6,766 rows. The owner
//     overruled it for PARITY: the two surfaces are one feature and a reader should not have to
//     learn it twice. The width was a real measurement, not an excuse, so it is answered rather
//     than dropped — the shared control takes a `compact` wording for this table, and
//     `tests/e2e/gearWishSteps.mts` measures what it leaves the item name in the browser.
//   * THE LIT NO-OP. A lit heart accepted clicks and did nothing, on the reasoning that `addWish`
//     dedupes so the model was the enforcement. Overruled: the second click REMOVES, through
//     `useWishlist.remove` — the same entry delete the Wish list tab's own per-row remove calls.
//
// The control itself is `features/wishlist/WishToggle.tsx` now; nothing about it is decided here.
