// gear/gearPrefs.ts — WHAT THE USER CHOSE about the Gear tab's shape, and how a stored choice
// degrades (JOS-297).
//
// TWO CHOICES, ONE SHAPE. Which numeric COLUMNS the table draws, and which FILTER CONTROLS the
// toolbar shows. Both are machine-class view preferences — they say how you like to READ the
// corpus, not anything about your character — so both live in raw `localStorage` under `eq.gear.*`
// and neither ever crosses IPC. (They shared that namespace with the sets pane's own two keys,
// `eq.gear.set` / `eq.gear.setsOpen`, until JOS-325 retired the pane; nothing reads those now.)
//
// ABSENT IS NOT EMPTY, and every function here exists to keep those two apart. `null` means the
// user has never expressed a preference, so the app's own default answers: the derived column seed
// (`gearColumns.visibleColumns`), and the full toolbar. An ARRAY — including `[]` — is a statement,
// and it wins outright. Folding the two together is the bug this file is shaped to prevent: it
// would make "I want no stat columns" unexpressible and would silently re-derive columns under
// somebody who had removed them.
//
// A STORED VALUE DEGRADES, IT NEVER ERRORS (JOS-105). Storage is a string somebody else's build
// wrote: it can be truncated JSON, an object, a key this version dropped, or the same key twice.
// The sanitizers take `unknown`, drop what they do not recognise and preserve the order of what
// they do — so a vocabulary change is a shrinking list rather than a blank tab.
//
// AND A HIDDEN CONTROL MAY NEVER BE FILTERING. `inertFilters` is the other half of a configurable
// toolbar and the half that is easy to skip: hiding "Current era" while it is ON would leave 3,000
// rows held back by a control that is not on screen to explain it, which is the exact failure the
// JOS-67 law names (a filter that can hide everything must be able to admit it). So a control that
// is hidden has its field forced to its INERT value — not its DEFAULT value, which for era is ON.
// The user's own value survives in state, so re-showing the control brings it back unchanged.
//
// PURE AND NODE-TESTABLE (relative value imports, the house law) — `tests/gearColumnPrefs.test.mts`
// drives every branch without a DOM, a React tree or a `localStorage`.

 * EVERY CONTROL A BARE-ARRAY CHOICE COULD HAVE BEEN CHOOSING FROM — the JOS-297 vocabulary, kept

 *
 * It exists because of a bug the owner reported on 2026-08-13 and a fix that was not what the
 * report asked for. The ask was *ALL filter controls on the equipment tab are ENABLED by default*,
 * on the belief that the picker "derives a default subset". IT DOES NOT, and never did:
 * `controlsVisible(null)` has always returned the whole of `GEAR_CONTROLS`, so a user who has never
 * touched the picker has always had every control. The DEFAULT was never the problem.
 *
 * THE ACTUAL DEFECT IS THAT A STORED CHOICE CANNOT SPEAK FOR A CONTROL THAT DID NOT EXIST YET.
 * The choice is stored as the list of controls to SHOW, so it is a closed statement about a
 * vocabulary frozen at the moment it was written. JOS-302 then changed that vocabulary: it deleted
 * `classOnly`, `ratio` and `thresholds` and ADDED `weapon`. Anyone who had used the picker before
 * JOS-302 — which includes the owner — therefore has a stored list that cannot contain `weapon`,
 * and no amount of re-reading it will ever draw the Weapon type picker for them. It is not hidden
 * because they hid it; it is hidden because they were never asked.
 *
 * SO THE RULE IS: A CONTROL THE USER NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO RULE ON IS ON. That is the owner's
 * ruling, applied to the mechanism that was actually broken, and it satisfies both halves of it at
 * once — every control draws unless the user explicitly hid it, and a user with a stored choice
 * keeps the hides they actually made.
