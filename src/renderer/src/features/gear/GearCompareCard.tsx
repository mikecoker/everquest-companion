// gear/GearCompareCard.tsx — HOVER AN ITEM AND SEE TWO CARDS: the item, and what you wear instead
// (JOS-338, restructured and REPAIRED by JOS-344).
//
// THE ONE DOOR. Every compare card this app draws comes through `GearRowCompare` below — the gear
// table's rows and, since JOS-344, the Exaltations browser's donor names — and that wrapper always
// passes the safe mode: the `SkyItemCard` pattern (JOS-181), for the same reason. "These cards
// cannot eat a click, and cannot open where a human will not see them" has to be a property of ONE
// file rather than of whoever edits `GearTable` or `EffectRows` next. `tests/gearCompare.test.mts`
// derives both halves from the tree.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE JOS-344 BUG, MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS FIXED — READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING THE MODIFIERS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The owner's report was that hovering a gear row showed NOTHING. It was not "nothing": the card
// was in the DOM, fully rendered, with the right words in it — and drawn 3 pixels from the right
// edge of a 1268px window, 99% of it past the glass. The e2e that shipped it only ever asked
// whether the node existed and what it said, which is exactly how an off-screen card ships.
//
// THE MEASUREMENT (headless run, default window, the Thelvorn row):
//     viewport            1268 × 848
//     the anchored <tr>   left 237 → right 1251      (the row is the FULL WIDTH of the table)
//     the popper          translate(1251px, 255px), 356 wide → right edge 1607
//     the card itself     left 1265 → right 1520      ⇒ 3px of it inside the window
//
// THE MECHANISM, and it is one inverted pair of axis names. Popper's `preventOverflow` calls the
// axis it slides along the MAIN one, and `getMainAxisFromPlacement` returns `'x'` for `top`/
// `bottom` placements and `'y'` for everything else. So for the `right-start` card JOS-338 wrote:
//   * `mainAxis` is the VERTICAL axis, and it was left ENABLED — the opposite of guarantee 1,
//   * `altAxis` is the HORIZONTAL one, and it was DISABLED — which switched off the only thing
//     that could have pulled the card back on screen,
//   * `flip` was off, so it could not escape left either.
// The old header says the reverse of both in prose ("for a right-placed popper the ALT axis is the
// vertical one"); the prose was wrong, the code did what the prose said rather than what it meant,
// and the anchor — a full-width `<TableRow>` whose right edge IS the window's right edge — turned
// that into a card nobody could see. All three are stated as source-regex pins in
// tests/gearCompare.test.mts now, so the next edit that flips one turns a unit test red.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ANCHORING LAW THAT REPLACES IT (JOS-344) — three guarantees, all structural
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//   1. IT CANNOT OPEN UPWARD, AND IT IS ANCHORED TO AN EDGE THAT IS ALWAYS ON SCREEN.
//      `bottom-start` — which is JOS-181's own click-through placement, arrived at there for this
//      same shape of defect — puts the pair's TOP-LEFT corner at the anchor's BOTTOM-LEFT corner.
//      For a bottom-placed popper `mainAxis` is the HORIZONTAL axis and `altAxis` the vertical, so
//      `{ mainAxis: true, altAxis: false }` now reads the way the words sound: the pair is CLAMPED
//      sideways to stay inside the window, and may never be moved vertically at all. With `flip`
//      off as well, the pair's top edge is ALWAYS its anchor's bottom edge — always below the row,
//      therefore always below the toolbar above the list. That is the JOS-127/JOS-143 guarantee,
//      and it is now a fact about the geometry rather than a hope about the axis names.
//
//      THE BRIEF ASKED FOR THE NAME CELL OR THE POINTER AS THE ANCHOR; this is neither, and the
//      reason is worth writing down. What made the card invisible was the row's RIGHT edge, and
//      `bottom-start` does not read it — it reads the row's LEFT edge, which is the name cell's
//      left edge, one pixel for one pixel, with no DOM coupling between this file and the table's
//      cell structure and no virtual-anchor plumbing to keep in step with two host surfaces. The
//      donor rows get the identical treatment for free: their anchor is the NAME itself.
//
//      THE PRICE, unchanged from JOS-181 and stated honestly: a pair anchored on a row near the
//      window's BOTTOM is clipped by the bottom edge rather than flipping above its row. That is
//      the trade this app has already made twice, and it is why every list on these cards is
//      capped (`MAX_STATS`, `MAX_DELTAS`) — the pair is short enough that the clipping costs a
//      line or two, where a flip would cost the toolbar.
//
//   2. IT HOLDS NO POINTER EVENTS. `disableInteractive` already leaves MUI's popper at
//      `pointer-events: none`; it is written out as well, because a library default is somebody
//      else's decision and this one IS the defect. It is also what makes the JOS-143 regression
//      test meaningful: `document.elementFromPoint` skips a pointer-events-none node, so the
//      toolbar, the wish heart (JOS-335), the name's Loot link and — since JOS-344 — the donor
//      row's Add button all still answer for their own centres with the pair open.
//
//   3. IT CLOSES ON POINTERDOWN, ANYWHERE, IN THE CAPTURE PHASE — so the pair is gone before the
//      Select the user just aimed at opens its own option list over the same band.
//
// Plus the SpellCard leave discipline (JOS-293): `enterDelay` so dragging the pointer across thirty
// dense rows opens nothing, and a short `leaveDelay` so it goes with the pointer.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY IT IS TWO CARDS AND NOT ONE (owner ruling 2026-08-13, JOS-344)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// JOS-338 drew ONE card with an equipped PANEL stacked inside it, and the owner ruled the other
// way: the hovered ITEM on the left, the CURRENTLY EQUIPPED on the right, side by side. The
// argument is the reading — a comparison read top-to-bottom is a list, a comparison read
// left-to-right is a comparison — and the layout is what makes the distinct treatment mean
// something: two surfaces, two accents, two borders, and no chance of mistaking what you HAVE for
// what you are READING ABOUT. The right card keeps everything the panel carried, including the
// dump freshness line, because that line is a claim about the right card's contents and nowhere
// else. When the first read has not settled there is NO right card — "we have not looked yet" is
// not an empty comparison (law 1).
//
// THE DRAWING IS `hoverCards.tsx`'s VOCABULARY — the same palette, `CardSection` and `MoreLine`
// that the mob card and the spell card use, so the hover cards in this app read as one family.
// What it deliberately does NOT reuse is `KnownItemTooltip`'s BODY: that card fetches
// `ItemKnowledge` over IPC to draw an EQ-style item window, and this one needs the numeric vector
// instead — both halves of a comparison have to be in one vocabulary or the delta is a guess. The
// renderer already holds the whole corpus (`useGearIndex`), so both sides are `GearRow`s joined by
// `itemKey`, the comparison costs ZERO IPC calls per hover on either surface, and the plus-state
// the table is simulating is already baked into the row this card is handed.
//
// EVERY WORD IS `gearCompare.ts`'s (pure, node-tested). This file owns where a line goes.
