// gear/areaMemory.ts — WHAT THE GEAR AREA REMEMBERS ABOUT ITS OWN FORMS, and for how long
// (JOS-329, owner report 2026-08-13, verbatim: *we're losing everything right now*).
//
// ============================================================================
// THE BUG THIS FILE EXISTS FOR
// ============================================================================
// A VIEW UNMOUNTS ON EVERY TAB SWITCH, so `useState` in one is a promise you cannot keep — the
// standing law (JOS-90, JOS-97, JOS-116, AGENTS.md), now reported for a FOURTH time over a whole
// area at once. The gear area is four tabs (`appViews.GEAR_AREA_VIEWS`) and App renders exactly one
// view at a time, so leaving Gear for Loot — or drilling into Loot from a wish row and pressing
// Back — destroyed every filter, every pick and every search box on the way out. Only the JOS-297
// chips survived, because they were the only state anybody had written down.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE RULE, WRITTEN DOWN ONCE, FOR ALL FOUR TABS
// ============================================================================
//   WHAT YOU **TYPED** IS SESSION-SCOPED.   WHAT YOU **CHOSE** IS RESTART-SCOPED.
//
// Both tiers survive the thing the ticket is actually about — leaving the area and coming back —
// because both are STORAGE and the view re-reads them on mount. They differ only in how long they
// outlive the process:
//
//   * RESTART tier (`localStorage`) — every closed-vocabulary pick and toggle. Classes, slots,
//     weapon types, effect kind, era, owned, the sort, the simulate-upgrade slider, the socket tab,
//     the donor slot, "usable by these classes", the grouping axis, the wish list's era toggle.
//     These are a SHAPE you gave the corpus: you chose them deliberately, they are visible as chips
//     and lit controls whenever the tab is up, and wanting them back next launch is the whole
//     reason the JOS-297 columns picker was persisted in the first place.
//
//   * SESSION tier (`sessionStorage`) — every free-text search box, plus the two narrowings you
//     reach BY typing or by poking the list: the Exaltations item picker, and which effect groups
//     are expanded. A week-old search string greeting a fresh launch is a worse surface, not a
//     better one — which is not a new opinion here, it is the argument `CarryAll.tsx` has carried
//     since JOS-327 and this file only generalises it.
//
// AND THE SPLIT IS DATA, NOT DISCIPLINE. `AREA_FORM_TIER` below maps every key to its tier and
// `useRemembered` looks the tier up from the key it was handed, so a call site CANNOT accidentally
// park a search box on the restart tier. That is the difference between a rule and a convention:
// the only way to move a field between tiers is to edit the table, in one place, on purpose.
//
// WHY `sessionStorage` RATHER THAN A MODULE-LEVEL `Map` for the session tier (the ticket offered
// both): it makes the two tiers ONE code path with ONE parameter — same reader, same writer, same
// sanitizers, the tier chosen by a lookup — so "one pattern applied uniformly" is literally true
// rather than aspirational. It also survives a renderer reload, which an in-memory map does not,
// so an HMR save in dev does not silently reproduce the bug this ticket fixes.
//
// ============================================================================
// A STORED VALUE DEGRADES, IT NEVER ERRORS (JOS-105, gearPrefs.ts's rule)
// ============================================================================
// Storage is a string somebody else's build wrote, and on this machine it is a file the user can
// edit. Every sanitizer below takes `unknown`, drops what it does not recognise and returns the
// caller's default for anything unusable — truncated JSON, an object where a list was, a slot this
// version dropped, a class abbreviation that never existed, a tier the slider cannot reach. There
// is no throw path and no `as` cast that is not preceded by a membership test.
//
// PURE AND NODE-TESTABLE, the `gearPrefs.ts` / `gearFilter.ts` precedent: value imports are
// RELATIVE (the house law), nothing here touches React, `window`, storage or IPC. The hooks that
// DO are next door in `useAreaMemory.ts`, and `tests/areaMemory.test.mts` drives every branch of
// this file without a DOM.

/**
 * THE SIMULATE-UPGRADE SLIDER — AND THE LAW THIS OVERRULES.
 *
 * THE OLD LAW (JOS-284, `gearData.useUpgradeState`): the plus-state was the ONE gear preference
 * deliberately not persisted. Its argument was that every other preference is a way of READING the
 * corpus while this one changes what the corpus SAYS — at +5 the table states numbers no item in
 * your bags has — so "a tab that silently reopened at +5 would be lying quietly, and the lie would
 * be invisible precisely because the slider is the thing you stopped looking at."
 *
 * THE OWNER OVERRULED IT ON 2026-08-13 (JOS-329): the slider is named in the list of form state
 * that must survive, alongside the filters and the sort. The ruling stands on its own, but the old
 * argument is answerable rather than merely outvoted, and it is worth writing down which premise
 * failed: **the lie was never quiet.** `UpgradeSlider` draws a permanent label stating exactly what
 * is being simulated in the item window's own words — `Tier 2  3/4  +27.5%`, the string
 * `gear-upgrade-label` and the e2e both read — and that label is on screen from the first paint of
 * every mount. A restored plus-state announces itself; it does not hide. What the old law was
 * really protecting against was state you could not see, and this control is the opposite of that.
 *
 * THE VALIDATION IS `normalizeUpgradeState`, NOT A SECOND OPINION. That function already owns the
 * only legal spelling of a state (full 0..10, fraction 0..2^full - 1, forced to 0 at both ends) and
 * is pinned by `tests/itemUpgrade.test.mts` — so a stored `{full: 99, fraction: -3}` comes back as
 * the cap with nothing banked, and a stored `{full: 3, fraction: 900}` comes back at that tier's
 * real maximum. Non-numbers fall through to base, which is the state the data is actually in.
