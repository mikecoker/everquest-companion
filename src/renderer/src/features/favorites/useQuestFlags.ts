// QUEST-LEVEL flags — favorite (star) and permanently ignored — as two small
// localStorage-backed sets, siblings of the ITEM-level `useFavorites` store and
// deliberately NOT overloading it: starring a quest and starring one of its drops are
// different intents, and conflating them is exactly the indirection that made quest
// favoriting undiscoverable.
//
// Renderer-local on purpose (same as `eq.favorites`): these never touch the main
// electron-store, so no persisted-store schema migration is involved.
//
// Entries are keyed by the app's canonical quest key (`questKey()` — `Class::Name`,
// the same key persisted completions use), lowercased here so a future casing drift in
// the bundled data can't silently orphan someone's stars. Never key by quest NAME
// alone: Sky quest names repeat across classes, so a name-keyed flag would star or
// hide every class's copy at once.

// JOS-148 added a THIRD key, at a different granularity: the CLASS star on the Sky tab's Classes
// tab. It gets its own key rather than reusing either of the two above, for the reason the header
// gives about items and quests — starring the Warrior class and starring Warrior Test of Think are
// different intents, and one key holding both would make a class star silently pin six quests.
// The store shape is identical (a set of lowercased keys in localStorage), so it is the same
// factory rather than a fourth copy of it.
